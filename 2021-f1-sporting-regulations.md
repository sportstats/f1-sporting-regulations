## ARTICLE 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
### 1.1 Formula One World Championship 
**1.1.1** The FIA will organise the FIA Formula One World Championship (the Championship) which is the property of the FIA and comprises two titles of World Champion, one for drivers and one for constructors. It consists of the Formula One Grand Prix races which are included in the Formula One calendar and in respect of which the ASNs and organisers have signed organisation agreements with the FIA. All the participating parties (FIA, ASNs, organisers, competitors and circuits) undertake to apply as well as observe the rules governing the Championship and must hold FIA Super Licences which are issued to drivers, competitors, officials, organisers and circuits. 
**1.1.2** The Championship and each of its Competitions is governed by the FIA in accordance with the Regulations. 
**1.1.3** In the sense of the Regulations, terms referring to natural persons are applicable to any gender. 
### 1.2 Regulatory Framework 
**1.2.1** The regulations applicable to the Championship are the International Sporting Code (the “Code”), the Formula One Technical Regulations (the “Technical Regulations”), the Formula One Sporting Regulations (the “Sporting Regulations”), the Formula One Financial Regulations (the “Financial Regulations”) and any other regulations applicable to the Championship as issued by the FIA from time to time, together referred to as the “Regulations”. 
**1.2.2** The Sporting Regulations are issued by the FIA and apply to the Championship taking place in the calendar year referred to in the title. Any changes made by the FIA for safety reasons may come into effect without notice or delay. 
**1.2.3** The definitive text of the Sporting Regulations shall be the English version which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Headings in this document are for ease of reference only and do not affect the meaning of the Sporting Regulations. 
### 1.3 General Undertakings 
**1.3.1** All drivers, competitors and officials participating in the Championship undertake, on behalf of themselves, their employees, agents and suppliers, to observe all the provisions (including supplemented or amended) of the Regulations. 
**1.3.2** It is the competitor's responsibility to ensure that all persons concerned by his entry observe all the requirements of the Regulations. If a competitor is unable to be present in person at the Competition he must nominate his representative in writing. The person having charge of an entered car during any part of a Competition is responsible jointly and severally with the competitor for ensuring that the requirements are observed. 
**1.3.3** Competitors must ensure that their cars comply with the conditions of eligibility and safety throughout practice and the race. 
**1.3.4** The presentation of a car for initial scrutineering (see Article 5.1 below) will be deemed an implicit statement of conformity. 
## ARTICLE 2: DEFINITIONS 
### 2.1 Constructor 
 A constructor is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which holds the intellectual property of the Listed Team Components (LTC) set out in Article 17 of the Technical Regulations. The make of an engine or chassis is the name attributed to it by its constructor. The obligation to design and use Listed Components shall not prevent a constructor from outsourcing the design and/or manufacture of any Listed Components to a third party in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Technical Regulations. If the make of the chassis is not the same as that of the engine, the title will be awarded to the former which shall always precede the latter in the name of the car. 
### 2.2 Championship Competition 
 Any Competition entered into the FIA F1 Championship Calendar for any year commencing five hours before P1 is scheduled to take place and including all practice and the race itself and ending at the later of the time for the lodging of a protest under the terms of the International Sporting Code or the time when a technical or sporting verification has been carried out under the terms of the International Sporting Code, whichever is the later. 
### 2.3 Automobile Make : 
 In the case of Formula racing cars, an automobile make is a complete car. When the car manufacturer fits an engine which it does not manufacture, the car name shall be the combination of the car manufacturer’s name and the engine manufacture’s name, with the former always preceding the latter. Should such a car win a Championship Title, Cup or Trophy, this will be awarded to the manufacturer of the car. 
## ARTICLE 3: WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND COMPETITIONS 
### 3.1 Championship Competitions 
**3.1.1** Competitions are reserved for Formula One cars as defined in the Technical Regulations. 
**3.1.2** Each Competition will have the status of an international restricted competition. 
**3.1.3** The distance of all races, from the start signal referred to in Article 4.8.9 to the end-of-race signal referred to in Article 4.16.1, shall be equal to the least number of complete laps which exceed a distance of 305km. However, should two hours’ elapse before the scheduled race distance is completed, the leader will be shown the end-of-race signal when he crosses the control line (the Line) at the end of the lap following the lap during which the two hour period ended, provided this does not result in the scheduled number of laps being exceeded. Only under the circumstances below will any exception be made to the above: a. The distance of the race in Monaco shall be equal to the least number of complete laps which exceed a distance of 260km. b. Should the race be suspended (see Article 4.14) the length of the suspension will be added to this period up to a maximum total race time of four hours. c. If the formation lap is started behind the safety car (see Article 4.8.14(c)) the number of race laps will be reduced by the number of laps carried out by the safety car minus one. 
**3.1.4** The maximum number of Competitions in the Championship is 25, the minimum is 10. 
**3.1.5** The final list of Competitions is published by the FIA before 1 January each year. 
**3.1.6** A Competition which is cancelled with less than three months’ written notice to the FIA will not be considered for inclusion in the following year's Championship unless the FIA judges the cancellation to have been due to force majeure. 
**3.1.7** A Competition may be cancelled if fewer than 12 cars are available for it. 
### 3.2 World Championship 
**3.2.1** The Formula One World Championship driver's title will be awarded to the driver who has scored the highest number of points, taking into consideration all the results obtained during the Competitions which have actually taken place. 
**3.2.2** The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor will be awarded to the competitor which has scored the highest number of points, results from both cars (see Article 3.4.7) being taken into account. 
**3.2.3** Points for both titles will be awarded at each Competition according to the following scale: 
 1st : 25 points 2nd : 18 points 3rd : 15 points 4th : 12 points 5th : 10 points 6th : 8 points 7th : 6 points 8th : 4 points 9th : 2 points 
 10th : 1 point In addition to the above, one point will be awarded to the driver who achieved the fastest valid lap time of the race and to the constructor whose car he was driving, subject to the following conditions: a. Only the lap achieved without incurring a penalty will be taken into account for each driver. b. He was in the top ten positions of the final race classification (see Article 4.17.1). For the avoidance of doubt, no point will be awarded if the fastest lap time, determined in compliance with the above, is achieved by a driver who was classified outside the top ten positions. 
**3.2.4** If a race is suspended under Article 4.14, and cannot be resumed, no points will be awarded if the leader has completed two laps or less, half points will be awarded if the leader has completed more than two laps but less than 75% of the original race distance and full points will be awarded if the leader has completed 75% or more of the original race distance. If the formation lap is started behind the safety car (see Article 4.8.14(c)), the original race distance will be deemed to be the distance calculated in accordance with Article 3.1.3(c). However, the maximum race time of four hours (see Article 3.1.3(b) will commence at the scheduled race start time. 
**3.2.5** Prizes and points awarded for all the positions of competitors who tie, will be added together and shared equally. 
**3.2.6** If two or more constructors or drivers finish the season with the same number of points, the higher place in the Championship (in either case) shall be awarded to: a. The holder of the greatest number of first places. b. If the number of first places is the same, the holder of the greatest number of second places. c. If the number of second places is the same, the holder of the greatest number of third places and so on until a winner emerges. d. If this procedure fails to produce a result, the FIA will nominate the winner according to such criteria as it thinks fit. 
**3.2.7** The drivers finishing first, second and third in the Championship must be present at the annual FIA Prize Giving ceremony. 
### 3.3 Licences 
**3.3.1** All drivers, competitors and officials participating in the Championship must hold a FIA Super Licence. Applications for Super Licences must be made annually to the FIA through the applicant's ASN. 
**3.3.2** With the exception of a reprimand or fine, when a penalty is applied under the International Sporting Code or Article 4.11.3 the stewards may impose penalty points on a driver’s Super Licence. If a driver accrues 12 penalty points his licence will be suspended for the following Competition, following which 12 points will be removed from the licence. Penalty points will remain on a driver’s Super Licence for a period of 12 months after which they will be respectively removed on the 12 month anniversary of their imposition. 
### 3.4 Competitors’ Applications and Entry Fees 
**3.4.1** Applications to compete in the Championship may be submitted to the FIA during the period 21 October to 1 November inclusive of the year prior to the year to which the application relates on an entry form as set out in Appendix 2 hereto accompanied by an undertaking to pay the entry fee, calculated in accordance with Article 3.4.2, and by a duly completed and signed staff registration form as set out in Appendix 5 hereto, to the FIA no later than 30 November of the year prior to the year to which the application relates. Applications at other times will only be considered if a place is available and on payment of a late entry fee to be fixed by the FIA.

A major car manufacturer may not directly or indirectly supply engines for more than three teams of two cars each without the consent of the FIA. For the purposes of this Article 3.4.4, a major car manufacturer is a company whose shares are quoted on a recognised stock exchange or the subsidiary of such a company.

## ARTICLE 4: SESSIONS AND TRACK RUNNING DURING A COMPETITION 
### 4.1 General Requirements 
**4.1.1** Official instructions will be given to drivers by means of the signals laid out in the International Sporting Code. Competitors must not use flags or lights similar to these. 
**4.1.2** Save where the Sporting Regulations require otherwise, pit lane and track discipline and safety measures will be the same for all practice sessions as for the race. 
**4.1.3** Other than by driving on the track, Competitors are not permitted to attempt to alter the grip of any part of the track surface. 
**4.1.4** If a car stops on the track it shall be the duty of the marshals to remove it as quickly as possible so that its presence does not constitute a danger or hinder other competitors. Under no circumstances may a driver stop his car on the track without justifiable reason. If any mechanical assistance received during the race results in the car re-joining the stewards may disqualify him from the race (other than under Article 4.1.7(d). 
**4.1.5** A driver who abandons a car must leave it in neutral or with the clutch disengaged, with the ERS shut down and with the steering wheel in place. 
**4.1.6** Save as specifically authorised by the International Sporting Code or the Sporting Regulations, no one except the driver may touch a stopped car unless it is in the paddock, the team’s designated garage area, the pit lane or on the starting grid. 
**4.1.7** During the period commencing fifteen minutes prior to and ending five minutes after every practice session and the period between the commencement of the formation lap which immediately precedes the race and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé, no one is allowed on the track, the pit entry or the pit exit with the exception of: a. Marshals or other authorised personnel in the execution of their duty. b. Drivers when driving or on foot, having first received permission to do so from a marshal. c. Team personnel when either pushing a car or clearing equipment from the grid after all cars able to do so have left the grid on the formation lap. d. Team personnel when assisting marshals to remove a car from the grid after the start of the race. 
**4.1.8** During a race, the engine may only be started with the starter except in the pit lane or the team’s designated garage area where the use of an external starting device is allowed. 
**4.1.9** Drivers taking part in practice and the race must always wear the clothes, helmets and head and neck supports specified in the International Sporting Code. 
**4.1.10** A speed limit of 80km/h will be imposed in the pit lane during the whole Competition. However, this limit may be amended: a. By the FIA F1 safety delegate at any time during a Competition. b. By the FIA, should it be deemed that the total time in the pit lane is too short in comparison with the time on the track between the pit entry and pit exit. Any changes in this case should in any case be communicated to the Teams and to the Tyre Supplier at the latest one week before the deadline set out in Article 6.2 (b). Any team whose driver exceeds the limit during any practice session will be fined €100 for each km/h above the limit, up to a maximum of €1000. However, in accordance with Article 3.11.1 the stewards may inflict an additional penalty if they suspect a driver was speeding in order to gain any sort of advantage. 
 During the race the stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) on any driver who exceeds the limit. 
**4.1.11** If a driver has serious mechanical difficulties he must leave the track as soon as it is safe to do so. 
**4.1.12** The lights described in Article 14.3 of the Technical Regulations must be illuminated at all times when using intermediate or wet-weather tyres. It shall be at the discretion of the race director to decide whether or not a driver should be stopped if no rear light is working. Should a car be stopped in this way the driver may re-join when the fault has been remedied. 
### 4.2 Driving 
**4.2.1** The driver must drive the car alone and unaided. 
**4.2.2** Drivers must observe the provisions of the International Sporting Code relating to driving behaviour on circuits at all times. 
**4.2.3** Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not deliberately leave the track without a justifiable reason. Drivers will be judged to have left the track if no part of the car remains in contact with it and, for the avoidance of doubt, any white lines defining the track edges are considered to be part of the track but the kerbs are not. Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join, however, this may only be done when it is safe to do so and without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the race director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he gained by leaving the track. 
**4.2.4** At no time may a car be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person. 
### 4.3 Pit Entry, Pit Lane and Pit Exit 
**4.3.1** The section of track between the first safety car line and the beginning of the pit lane will be designated the “pit entry”. 
**4.3.2** The section of track between the end of the pit lane and the second safety car line will be designated the “pit exit”. 
**4.3.3** At no time may a car be reversed in the pit lane under its own power. 
**4.3.4** The pit lane will be divided into two lanes, the lane closest to the pit wall will be designated the "fast lane" and may be no more than 3.5 metres wide, the lane closest to the garages will be designated the "inner lane". Other than when cars are at the end of the pit lane under Articles 4.8.2 and 4.14, the inner lane is the only area where any work can be carried out on a car. However, no work may be carried out in the fast lane if it is likely to hinder other cars attempting to leave the pit lane. 
**4.3.5** The FIA will allocate garages and an area in the pit lane on a strictly equal basis where each team may work and, within each of these designated garage areas, one position where pit stops during both practice and the race may be carried out. 
**4.3.6** No powered device may be used to lift any part of a car in the pit lane during a race. 
**4.3.7** Unless a car is pushed from the grid at any time during the start procedure, cars may only be driven from the team’s designated garage area to the end of the pit lane. Any car(s) driven to the end of the pit lane prior to the start or re-start of a practice session must form up in a line in the fast lane and leave in the order they got there unless another car is unduly delayed. 
**4.3.8** With the exception of the reconnaissance laps permitted by Article 4.8.1, any driver that is required to start the race from the pit lane may not drive his car from his team’s designated garage area until 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap and must stop in a line in the fast lane. Under these circumstances working in the fast lane will be permitted but any such work is restricted to: a. Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation. b. The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices. c. Changes made for driver comfort. d. Changing wheels and tyres. When cars are permitted to leave the pit lane they must do so in the order that was established under Article 4.8.2 unless another car is unduly delayed. At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals. 
**4.3.9** Other than by drying or sweeping, or by laying tyre rubber when cars leave their pit stop position, competitors may not attempt to enhance the grip of the surface in the pit lane unless a problem has been clearly identified and a solution agreed to by the FIA safety delegate. 
**4.3.10** Competitors must not paint lines on any part of the pit lane. 
**4.3.11** Other than under 4.3.8 above no equipment may be left in the fast lane. 
**4.3.12** Team personnel are only allowed in the pit lane immediately before they are required to work on a car and must withdraw as soon as the work is complete. All team personnel carrying out any work on a car in the pit lane when the car is in its pit stop position during the qualifying practice session, or during a race pit stop, must be wearing helmets which meet or exceed the requirements of ECE 22.05 European motorcycle road helmet, DOT USA motorcycle road helmet or JIS T8133-2015, class 2 – JPN protective helmets for motor vehicle users. The use of appropriate eye protection is compulsory. 
**4.3.13** When releasing the car from a pit stop the following conditions must apply: 
 a. Cars must not be released from a garage or pit stop position in way that could endanger pit lane personnel or another driver. Competitors must provide a means of clearly establishing, when being viewed from both above and in the front of the car, when a car was released. b. If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during any practice session, the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate. c. If a car is deemed to have been released in an unsafe condition during a race a penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on the driver concerned. However, if the driver retires from the race as a result of the car being released in an unsafe condition a fine may be imposed upon the team. d. An additional penalty will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, continues to drive a car knowing it to have been released in an unsafe condition. In all of the above cases, a car will be deemed to have been released either when it has been driven out of its designated garage area (when leaving from the garage) or after it has completely cleared its pit stop position following a pit stop. 
**4.3.14** Under exceptional circumstances the race director may ask for the pit entry to be closed during the race for safety reasons. At such times drivers may only enter the pit lane in order for essential and entirely evident repairs to be carried out to the car. A penalty under Article 
 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, entered the pit lane for any other reason whilst it was closed. 
### 4.4 Practice Sessions 
**4.4.1** No driver may start in the race without taking part in at least one practice session. 
**4.4.2** During all practices there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars may only leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light will be shown in the pit exit to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are approaching on the track. 
**4.4.3** Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be used for purposes other than the Competition after the last practice session on each day of practice and on the day of the race no less than one hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to allow cars to cover a reconnaissance lap. 
**4.4.4** In the event of a driving infringement during any practice session the Stewards may delete a driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate. Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any such incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session. Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 3.11.1. 
**4.4.5** Any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the penalties referred to in Article 4.4.4. 
**4.4.6** Should it become necessary to stop any practice session because the circuit is blocked by an accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line. When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place. At the end of each practice session no driver may cross the Line more than once. 
**4.4.7** The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during qualifying practice will the session be extended as a result. Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start. 
### 4.5 Free Practice 
 Two free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one and a half hours and separated by at least two hours, will take place on the first day of the Competition. A further free practice session (P3), lasting one hour and starting no less than seventeen and a half hours after the end of P2, will take place the day before the race. 
### 4.6 Qualifying Practice 
**4.6.1** The qualifying practice session will take place on the day before the race and will start no less than two hours after the end of P3. The session will be run as follows: a. For the first eighteen minutes of the session (Q1) all cars will be permitted on the track and at the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session. Lap times achieved by the fifteen remaining cars will then be deleted. b. After a seven-minute break the session will resume for fifteen minutes (Q2) and the fifteen remaining cars will be permitted on the track. At the end of this period the slowest five cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session. Lap times achieved by the ten remaining cars will then be deleted. c. After an eight-minute break the session will resume for twelve minutes (Q3) and the ten remaining cars will be permitted on the track. The above procedure is based upon 20 cars being officially eligible to take part in the Competition. If 22 cars are eligible six will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, if 24 cars are eligible seven cars will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, and so on if more cars are eligible. 
**4.6.2** Any driver whose car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session will not be permitted to take any further part in the session. 
**4.6.3** At the end of qualifying practice the times achieved by each driver will be officially published. 
**4.6.4** An AOT, as defined in F1 Technical Regulations, must be empty during the complete qualifying practice session. 
### 4.7 The Grid 
**4.7.1** Unless the track was declared wet by the race director, any driver eliminated during Q1 whose best qualifying lap exceeds 107% of the fastest time set during that session, or who fails to set a time, will not be allowed to take part in the race. Under exceptional circumstances however, which may include setting a suitable lap time in a free practice session, the stewards may permit the car to start the race. Any driver accepted in this manner will be placed at the back of the starting grid after any other penalties have been applied, and behind any driver penalised under Article 5.7 or 5.8. Should there be more than one driver accepted in this manner they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in P3. 
**4.7.2** The grid will be drawn up as follows: 
 a. The last five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q1, the fastest in 16th position. b. The next five positions will be occupied by the cars eliminated during Q2, the fastest in 11th position. c. The top ten positions will be occupied by the cars which took part in Q3, the fastest from the position on the grid which was the pole position in the previous year or, on a new circuit, has been designated as such by the FIA safety delegate. If two or more drivers set identical times during Q1, Q2 or Q3 priority will be given to the one who set it first. 
 If more than 20 cars are entered in the Championship appropriate amendments will be made to the above in accordance with Article 4.6.1. d. If more than one driver fails to set a time during Q2 or Q3 they will be arranged in the following order: i. Any driver who attempted to set a qualifying time by starting a flying lap. ii. Any driver who failed to start a flying lap. iii. Any driver who failed to leave the pits during the period. e. Once the grid has been established in accordance with (a) and (b) above, grid position penalties will be applied to the drivers in question in the order the offences were committed. If, following qualifying, more than one driver incurs a penalty under Article 5.7 or 5.8 preference will be given to the driver whose team first informed the technical delegate that a power unit or gearbox change will be carried out. f. Any driver required to start the race from the back of the grid after incurring a penalty under Article 5.7.3 will be arranged on the grid behind any driver penalised under (e) above. If more than one driver is required to start the race from the back of the grid they will be arranged in qualifying order. g. Any driver who incurs a penalty under Article 5.7 or 5.8 will take precedence over any driver whose qualifying times have been deleted for any reason. If more than one driver falls into a single category in b) or e) above they will be arranged on the grid in the order they were classified in the previous period of qualifying or, in the case of Q1, the order they were classified in P3. 
**4.7.3** The starting grid will be published no less than four hours before the start of the formation lap. Any competitor whose car(s) is (are) unable to start for any reason whatsoever (or who has good reason to believe that their car(s) will not be ready to start) must inform the stewards accordingly at the earliest opportunity and, in any event, no later than one hour and fifteen minutes before the start of the formation lap. If one or more cars are withdrawn the grid will be closed up accordingly. The final starting grid will be published one hour before the start of the formation lap. 
**4.7.4** The grid will be in a staggered 1 x 1 formation and the rows on the grid will be separated by 16 metres. 
### 4.8 Starting Procedure 
**4.8.1** 40 minutes before the start of the formation lap the pit exit will be opened and all cars, including any that are required to start the race from the pit lane, will be permitted to leave the pit lane to cover a reconnaissance lap. Should any driver wish to cover more than one reconnaissance lap, this must be done by driving down the pit lane at greatly reduced speed between each of the laps. If a driver stops in his pit between reconnaissance laps the car may only re-join the track by being driven from the driver’s garage and not from his pit stop position. At the end of these laps all cars starting the race from the grid should stop on the grid in starting order with their engines stopped. All drivers going to the pit exit at this time must do so at a constant speed and with constant throttle. This applies over the whole of the pit lane whether a driver is going to the pit exit from his garage or travelling through the pit lane between reconnaissance laps. Any car which does not complete a reconnaissance lap and reach the grid under its own power will not be permitted to start the race from the grid. 
**4.8.2** 32 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap, a warning signal will be given indicating that the end of the pit lane will be closed in two minutes. 30 minutes before the scheduled start of the formation lap the end of the pit lane will be closed and a second warning signal will be given. Any car which is still in the pit lane can start from the end of the pit lane provided it got there under its own power. If more than one car is affected they must line up in the order in which they qualified. However, any car reaching the end of the pit lane after the five minute signal must start behind any car already at the pit exit. All such cars may then join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time after the start. 
**4.8.3** The approach of the start will be announced by signals shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one-minute and fifteen seconds before the start of the formation lap, each of which will be accompanied by an audible warning. When the ten minute signal is shown, everybody except drivers, officials and team technical staff must leave the grid. 
**4.8.4** When the three minute signal is shown all cars on the grid must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed in the pit lane. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the three minute signal. 
**4.8.5** When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the grid by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them. If any team personnel or team equipment remain on the grid after the 15 second signal has been shown the driver of the car concerned must start the race from the pit lane as specified in Article 4.8.2. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane. If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the grid, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the pit lane. In either of the above cases, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind. 
**4.8.6** When the green lights are illuminated, all cars on the grid should begin the formation lap with the pole position driver leading. When leaving the grid all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. Marshals will be instructed to push any car (or cars) which remain on the grid into the pit lane by the fastest route immediately after cars able to do so have left the grid. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car and must follow the instructions of the marshals. 
**4.8.7** During the formation lap practice starts are forbidden and the formation must be kept as tight as possible. 
**4.8.8** Overtaking during the formation lap is only permitted if a car is delayed and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field. In this case, drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order. Any driver delayed in this way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line, must enter the pit lane and start from the end of the pit lane as specified in Article 4.8.2. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line. 
**4.8.9** When the cars come back to the grid at the end of the formation lap (or laps, see Articles 4.8.14(c) and 4.15.5), they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines running. There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the permanent starter. Once all the cars have come to a halt the five second light will appear followed by the four, three, two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, the race will be started by extinguishing all red lights. If, after the start, a car is immobilised on the starting grid marshals alongside the grid will wave their yellow flags to inform the drivers that a car is stationary on the grid. It shall be the duty of the marshals to push it into the pit lane by the fastest route. Any driver being pushed from the grid may not attempt to start the car. Once the car is in the pit lane his mechanics may attempt to start it, if successful the driver may re-join the race. The driver and mechanics must follow the instructions of the track marshals at all times during such a procedure. 
**4.8.10** Unless specifically authorised by the FIA safety delegate, during the start of a race the pit wall must be kept free of all persons with the exception of the team personnel permitted under Article 5.10.3, officials and fire marshals. 
**4.8.11** If, after returning to the starting grid at the end of the formation lap a problem arises, the following procedures shall apply: a. If a car develops a problem that could endanger the start the driver must immediately raise his hands above his head and the marshal responsible for that row must immediately wave a yellow flag. If the race director decides the start should be aborted the green lights will be illuminated two seconds after the abort lights are switched on, a board saying “EXTRA FORMATION LAP” will be displayed and all cars able to do so must complete a further formation lap whilst the car which developed the problem is moved into the pit lane. When leaving the grid to complete the extra formation lap all drivers must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The team may then attempt to rectify the problem and, if successful, the car may then start from the end of the pit lane. Should there be more than one car involved their starting order will be determined by the order in which they reached the end of the pit lane. Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap. b. If another problem arises which does not necessitate a delay to the start (see c) below), drivers will be asked to carry out an extra formation lap as set out in a) above. Any driver who caused the start to be aborted, and is then able to start the extra formation lap must enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and start the race as specified in Article 4.8.2. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to start the race from the pit lane. c. If any other problem arises, and if the race director decides the start should be delayed, the following procedures shall apply: i. If the race has not been started, the abort lights will be switched on, a board saying “DELAYED START” will be displayed, engines should be stopped and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least five minutes warning will be given. Tyre changing on the grid is not permitted during such a delay. 
 Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one lap. ii. If the race has been started the marshals alongside the grid will wave their yellow flags to inform the drivers that a car is stationary on the grid. 
**4.8.12** Should Article 4.8.11 apply, the race will nevertheless count for the Championship no matter how often the procedure is repeated, or how much the race is shortened as a result. 
**4.8.13** Either of the penalties under Articles 4.11.3(c) or d) will be imposed on any driver who is judged to have: a. Moved before the start signal is given, such judgement being made by an FIA approved and supplied transponder fitted to each car, or ; b. Positioned his car on the starting grid in such a way that the transponder is unable to detect the moment at which the car first moved from its grid position after the start signal is given. 
**4.8.14** Only in the following cases will any variation in the start procedure be allowed: 
 a. If it starts to rain after the five minute signal but before the race is started and, in the opinion of the race director teams should be given the opportunity to change tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and the starting procedure will begin again at the ten minute point. b. If the start of the race is imminent and, in the opinion of the race director, the volume of water on the track is such that it cannot be negotiated safely even on wet-weather tyres, the abort lights will be shown on the Line and all teams will be informed of the likely delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least ten minutes warning will be given. c. If track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race at the scheduled time the start of the formation lap may take place behind the safety car. If this is the case, at the ten minute signal its orange lights will be illuminated, this being the signal to the drivers that the formation lap will be started behind the safety car. At the same time this will be confirmed to all teams via the official messaging system. When the green lights are illuminated the safety car will leave the grid and all drivers must follow in grid order, no more than ten car lengths apart, and must respect the pit lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The safety car will continue until conditions are considered suitable for racing. Any cars that were starting the race from the pit lane may join the formation lap once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane for the first time. Any such cars may complete all formation laps but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there. Any other car entering the pit lane during the formation laps may re-join the track but must enter the pit lane after the safety car returns to the pits and start the race from the end of the pit lane in the order they get there. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose tyre(s) are changed for a different specification before the start of the race. Overtaking during the lap(s) behind the safety car is only permitted under the following circumstances: i. If a car is delayed when leaving the grid and cars behind cannot avoid passing it without unduly delaying the remainder of the field, or ii. If there is more than one car starting from the pit lane and one of them is unduly delayed. 
 In either case drivers may only overtake to re-establish the original starting order or the order the cars at the pit exit were in when the formation lap was started. Any driver delayed in either way, and who is unable to re-establish the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits, must enter the pit lane and may only join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the start of the race. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it. Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those required to start from the pit lane, must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 4.8.9 to 4.8.13. If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it. As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line. No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The race will be deemed to have started when the leading car crosses the Line after the safety car has returned to the pits. If, after several formation laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race, the message “START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures described in Articles 4.14 and 4.15 must then be followed and there will be no standing start. 
### 4.9 The Race 
 During the race, drivers leaving the pit lane may only do so when the light at the end of the pit lane is green and on their own responsibility. A marshal with a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light, will also warn the driver if cars are approaching on the track. 
### 4.10 Devices to facilitate overtaking 
**4.10.1 Driver adjustable bodywork permitted by Article 3.10.10 of the Technical Regulations:** 
 a. The adjustable bodywork may only be activated by the driver in any of the predetermined activation zones around each circuit. In conditions of poor visibility however 
 the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve. If the adjustable bodywork is disabled in this way at any time during any of the three periods of the qualifying practice session (Q1, Q2 or Q3) it will remain disabled for the remainder of the relevant period. b. For the sole purpose of improving overtaking opportunities during the race the adjustable bodywork may be activated by the driver after he has completed two laps after the race start or following a safety car period. The driver may only activate the adjustable bodywork in the race when he has been notified via the control electronics (see Article 8.2 of the F1 Technical Regulations) that it is enabled. It will be enabled, and may only be used by the driver, if he is less than one second behind another at any of the pre-determined detection points around each circuit. The system will be disabled by the control electronics the first time the driver uses the brakes after he has activated the system. In conditions of poor visibility, or if yellow flags are being shown in the activation zone, the race director may, at his absolute discretion, disable all such systems until conditions improve or yellow flags are withdrawn. The FIA may, after consulting all competitors, adjust the above time proximity in order to ensure the stated purpose of the adjustable bodywork is met. c. In the event of a failure in the system which notifies the driver that he was within one second of the car in front, and is hence authorised to use the adjustable bodywork, the team concerned may ask the race director for permission to override the system. If permission is given in this way the onus will be upon the team concerned to ensure that their driver only uses the adjustable bodywork if he is within one second of the car in front of him. If the failure in the system is rectified the driver may no longer use this override, the race director will notify the team if and when the fault has been remedied. 
### 4.11 Incidents During the Race 
**4.11.1** The race director may report any on-track incident or suspected breach of the Sporting Regulations or the International Sporting Code (an “Incident”) to the stewards. After review it shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide whether or not to proceed with an investigation. The stewards may also investigate an Incident noted by themselves. 
**4.11.2** It shall be at the discretion of the stewards to decide if any driver involved in an Incident should be penalised. Unless it is clear to the stewards that a driver or drivers were wholly or predominantly to blame for an Incident no penalty will be imposed. If an Incident is under investigation by the stewards a message informing all teams which driver or drivers are involved will be sent via the official messaging system. Provided that such a message is displayed no later than 60 minutes after the race has finished the driver or drivers concerned may not leave the circuit without the consent of the stewards. 
**4.11.3** The stewards may impose any one of the penalties below on any driver involved in an Incident: 
 a. A five second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least five seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned. 
 b. A ten second time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race. The relevant driver may however elect not to stop, provided he carries out no further pit stop before the end of the race. In such cases ten seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned. In both of the above cases the driver concerned must carry out the penalty the next time he enters the pit lane and, for the avoidance of doubt, this includes any stop the driver makes whilst a VSC or safety car procedure is in use. c. A drive-through penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane and re-join the race without stopping. d. A ten second stop-and-go time penalty. The driver must enter the pit lane, stop in his pit stop position for at least ten seconds and then re-join the race. If any of the four penalties above are imposed upon a driver, and that driver is unable to serve the penalty due to retirement from the race, the stewards may impose a grid place penalty on the driver at his next Competition. If any of the four penalties above are imposed during the last three laps, or after the end of a race, Article 4.11.4(b) below will not apply and five seconds will be added to the elapsed race time of the driver concerned in the case of (a) above, 10 seconds in the case of (b), 20 seconds in the case of (c) and 30 seconds in the case of (d). e. A time penalty. f. A reprimand. g. A drop of any number of grid positions at the driver’s next Competition. If any of the seven penalties above are imposed they shall not be subject to appeal. h. Disqualification from the results. i. Suspension from the driver’s next Competition. 
**4.11.4** Should the stewards decide to impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d), the following procedure will be followed: a. The stewards will give written notification of the penalty which has been imposed to the competitor concerned and will inform all teams via the official messaging system. b. With the exception of Articles 4.11.3(a) and (b) above, from the time the team concerned is notified of the stewards’ decision via the official messaging system the relevant driver may cross the Line on the track no more than twice before entering the pit lane and, in the case of a penalty under Article 4.11.3(d), proceeding to his pit stop position where he shall remain for the period of the time penalty. However, unless the driver was already in the pit entry for the purpose of serving his penalty, he may not carry out the penalty if the VSC procedure is in use or after the safety car has been deployed. The number of times the driver crosses the Line behind the safety car or during the VSC procedure will be added to the maximum number of times he may cross the Line on the track. c. Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a penalty under Articles 4.11.3(a) or (b) above it may not be worked on until the car has been stationary for the duration of the penalty. d. Whilst a car is stationary in the pit lane as a result of incurring a time penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) above it may not be worked on. However, if the engine stops any work necessary to re-start it may be carried out after the time penalty period has elapsed. If the team is unable to start the engine the car may then only be worked on in the driver’s garage. 
 e. Any breach or failure to comply with Articles 4.11.4 (b), (c) or (d) may result in the car being disqualified. 
### 4.12 Safety Car 
**4.12.1** The FIA safety car will be driven by an FIA appointed driver and will carry an FIA observer capable of recognising all the competing cars who is in permanent radio contact with race control. 
**4.12.2** Fifty minutes before the start of the formation lap the safety car will leave the pit lane and take up position at the front of the grid and remain there until the five minute signal is given. At this point (except under Article 4.8.14(c)) it will cover a whole lap of the circuit and take up position. 
**4.12.3** The safety car may be brought into operation to neutralise a race upon the order of the clerk of the course. It will be used only if competitors or officials are in immediate physical danger on or near the track but the circumstances are not such as to necessitate suspending the race. 
**4.12.4** When the order is given to deploy the safety car the message "SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SC” and all marshal's posts will display waved yellow flags and "SC" boards for the duration of the intervention. 
**4.12.5** No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the safety car is deployed. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry or the pit lane. 
**4.12.6** The safety car will join the track with its orange lights illuminated and will do so regardless of where the race leader is. 
**4.12.7** All competing cars must reduce speed and form up in line behind the safety car no more than ten car lengths apart. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at which all teams have been sent the “SAFETY CAR DEPLOYED” message via the official messaging system until the time that each car crosses the first safety car line for the second time, drivers must stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). The stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above. 
**4.12.8** With the exception of the cases listed under (a) to (h) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track, including the safety car, until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The exceptions are: a. If a driver is signalled to do so from the safety car. b. Under 4.8.14(c) or 4.12.12 below. c. When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track, including the safety car, after he has reached the first safety car line. d. When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line. e. When the safety car is returning to the pits it may be overtaken by cars on the track once it has reached the first safety car line. f. Whilst in the pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas. 
 g. Any car stopping in its designated garage area whilst the safety car is using the pit lane (see 4.12.11 below) may be overtaken. h. If any car slows with an obvious problem. 
**4.12.9** When ordered to do so by the clerk of the course the observer in the car will use a green light to signal to any cars between it and the race leader that they should pass. These cars will continue at reduced speed and without overtaking until they reach the line of cars behind the safety car. 
**4.12.10** Except under 4.12.12 below, the safety car shall be used at least until the leader is behind it and all remaining cars are lined up behind him. Once behind the safety car, the race leader must keep within ten car lengths of it (except under 4.12.13 below). 
**4.12.11** Under certain circumstances the clerk of the course may ask the cars and the safety car to use the pit lane. In these cases, a signal to use the pit lane will be displayed before the start of the pit entry and all teams will be informed via the official messaging system, all cars must then enter the pit lane, drive through it and re-join the track. Any car entering the pit lane under these circumstances may however stop at its designated garage area. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(c) will be imposed on any driver who fails to enter the pit lane when required to do so. Other than when the cars and the safety car are required to use the pit lane, no car may enter the pits whilst the safety car is deployed unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres. 
**4.12.12** If the clerk of the course considers it safe to do so, and the message "LAPPED CARS MAY NOW OVERTAKE" has been sent to all teams via the official messaging system, any cars that have been lapped by the leader will be required to pass the cars on the lead lap and the safety car. This will only apply to cars that were lapped at the time they crossed the Line at the end of the lap during which they crossed the first Safety Car line for the second time after the safety car was deployed. Having overtaken the cars on the lead lap and the safety car these cars should then proceed around the track at an appropriate speed, without overtaking, and make every effort to take up position at the back of the line of cars behind the safety car. Whilst they are overtaking, and in order to ensure this may be carried out safely, the cars on the lead lap must always stay on the racing line unless deviating from it is unavoidable. Unless the clerk of the course considers the presence of the safety car is still necessary, once the last lapped car has passed the leader the safety car will return to the pits at the end of the following lap. If the clerk of the course considers track conditions are unsuitable for overtaking the message "OVERTAKING WILL NOT BE PERMITTED" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system. 
**4.12.13** When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car the message "SAFETY CAR IN THIS LAP" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it. In order to avoid the likelihood of accidents before the safety car returns to the pits, from the point at which the lights on the car are turned out drivers must proceed at a pace which involves no erratic acceleration or braking nor any other manoeuvre which is likely to endanger other drivers or impede the restart. As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the SC boards will be withdrawn and, other than on the last lap of the race, as the leader approaches the Line the yellow flags will be withdrawn and a green flag will be displayed at the Line. 
**4.12.14** Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap. However, if the procedure set out in Article 4.8.14(c) is followed Article 3.1.3(c) will apply. 
**4.12.15** If the safety car is still deployed at the beginning of the last lap, or is deployed during the last lap, it will enter the pit lane at the end of the lap and the cars will take the end-of-race signal as normal without overtaking. 
### 4.13 Virtual Safety Car (VSC) 
**4.13.1** The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session or a race upon the order of the clerk of the course. It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself. 
**4.13.2** When the order is given to initiate the VSC procedure a message "VSC DEPLOYED" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”. 
**4.13.3** No car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person at any time whilst the VSC procedure is in use. This will apply whether any such car is being driven on the track, the pit entry or the pit lane. 
**4.13.4** When initiated during a race, no car may enter the pits whilst the VSC procedure is in use unless it is for the purpose of changing tyres. 
**4.13.5** All competing cars must reduce speed and stay above the minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector and at both the first and second safety car lines (a marshalling sector is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All cars must also be above this minimum time when the FIA light panels change to green (see 4.13.7 below). When initiated during a race, the stewards may impose either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(a), (b), (c) or (d) on any driver who fails to stay above the minimum time as required by the above. 
**4.13.6** With the exception of the cases listed under a) to d) below, no driver may overtake another car on the track whilst the VSC procedure is in use. The exceptions are: a. When entering the pits a driver may pass another car remaining on the track after he has reached the first safety car line. b. When leaving the pits a driver may overtake, or be overtaken by, another car on the track before he reaches the second safety car line. c. Whilst in the pit entry, pit lane or pit exit a driver may overtake another car which is also in one of these three areas. d. If any car slows with an obvious problem. 
**4.13.7** When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to end the VSC procedure the message "VSC ENDING" will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and, at any time between 10 and 15 seconds later, “VSC” on the FIA light panels will change to green and drivers may continue the session or continue racing immediately. After 30 seconds the green lights will be extinguished. 
**4.13.8** Each lap completed whist the VSC procedure is in use during a race will be counted as a race lap. 
### 4.14 Suspending a Race 
**4.14.1** If competitors or officials are placed in immediate physical danger by cars running on the track, and the clerk of the course deems circumstances are such that the track cannot be negotiated safely, even behind the safety car, the race will be suspended. Should it become necessary to suspend the race, the clerk of the course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at the Line. 
**4.14.2** When the signal is given overtaking is forbidden, the pit exit will be closed and all cars must proceed slowly into the pit lane. The first car to arrive in the pit lane should proceed directly to the pit exit staying in the fast lane, all the other cars should form up in a line behind the first car. 
**4.14.3** Any cars unable to return to the pit lane as a result of the track being blocked will be brought back when the track is cleared and will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended. Additionally, any cars in the pit lane or pit entry at the time the race was suspended will be arranged in the order they occupied before the race was suspended. Any cars in their garage at the time the race was suspended will be arranged at the back of the line of cars in the fast lane in the order they got there. Any such cars will be permitted to leave the pit lane when the race is resumed but must re-enter the pit lane when the safety car returns and may join the race once the last car has passed the pit exit after the re-start (also see Article 4.15.8). In all cases the order will be taken at the last point at which it was possible to determine the position of all cars. All such cars will then be permitted to resume the race. The Safety Car will then be driven to the front of the line of cars in the fast lane. 
**4.14.4** Whilst the race is suspended: 
 a. Neither the race nor the timekeeping system will stop, however, in accordance with Article 3.1.3 the length of the race suspension will be added to the maximum two hour period. b. Cars may be worked on once they have stopped in the fast lane but any such work is restricted to that listed in i) to ix) below and must not impede the resumption of the race. i. Starting the engine and any directly associated preparation. ii. The addition of compressed gases (see Article 4.5 of the F1 Technical Regulations). iii. The fitting or removal of permitted cooling and heating devices. iv. Changes to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes. v. Changes to the radiator ducts. vi. Changes made for driver comfort. vii. Changing wheels and tyres. viii. Repair of genuine accident damage, including the replacement of assemblies containing such damaged parts. ix. The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced. c. Only team members, officials and duly accredited television cameramen will be permitted in the pit lane. 
**4.14.5** Unless asked to do so by the FIA, cars may not be moved from the fast lane whilst the race is suspended. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(c) will be imposed on any driver whose car is moved from the fast lane to any other part of the pit lane. At all times drivers must follow the directions of the marshals. 
### 4.15 Resuming a Race 
**4.15.1** The delay will be kept as short as possible and as soon as a resumption time is known all teams will be informed via the official messaging system, in all cases at least ten minutes warning will be given. 
**4.15.2** Signals will be shown ten minutes, five minutes, three minutes, one minute and fifteen seconds before the resumption and each of these will be accompanied by an audible warning. 
**4.15.3** When the three minute signal is shown all cars must have their wheels fitted, after this signal wheels may only be removed if the car has been moved out of the fast lane or during a further race suspension. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car did not have all its wheels fully fitted at the three minute signal or has any of its wheels changed before it leaves the pit lane after the race has been resumed. At the two minute point any cars between the safety car and the leader, in addition to any cars that had been lapped by the leader at the time the race was suspended, will be allowed to leave the pit lane and complete a further lap, without overtaking, and join the line of cars behind the safety car which left the pit lane when the race was resumed. 
**4.15.4** When the one minute signal is shown, engines should be started and all team personnel must leave the fast lane by the time the 15 second signal is given taking all equipment with them. If any driver needs assistance after the 15 second signal he must raise his arm and, when the remainder of the cars able to do so have left the pit lane, marshals will be instructed to push the car into the slow lane. In this case, marshals with yellow flags will stand beside any car (or cars) concerned to warn drivers behind. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to pass any car unable to leave the pit lane. 
**4.15.5** The race will be resumed behind the safety car when the green lights are illuminated. The safety car will enter the pits after one lap unless: a. The race is being resumed in wet conditions and the race director deems more than one lap necessary, in which case see Article 6.4(m). b. All cars are not yet in a line behind the safety car. c. A further incident occurs necessitating another intervention. When the green lights are illuminated the safety car will leave the pit lane and all drivers must follow, no more than ten car lengths apart. 
**4.15.6** Overtaking behind the safety car is only permitted in the following cases: 
 a. Any driver who is delayed when leaving his position in the fast lane or during the lap(s) behind the safety car may overtake to re-establish his original starting position provided he does so before he crosses the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. Should he fail to do so he must re-enter the pit lane and may only re-join the race once the whole field has passed the end of the pit lane after the race has been resumed. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who fails to re-enter the pit lane if he has not re-established the original starting order before he reaches the first safety car line on the lap the safety car returns to the pits. 
 b. Drivers may leave the fast lane in order to overtake any car delayed when leaving its position in the fast lane. Any driver whose car has been pushed from the fast lane, in accordance with Article 4.15.4 above, may not overtake in order to re-establish the order before the race was suspended. 
**4.15.7** Either of the penalties under Article 4.11.3(c) or (d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the opinion of the stewards, unnecessarily overtook another car during the lap (or laps). 
**4.15.8** When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it. Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those that were in their garage at the time the race was suspended (see Article 4.14.3), must return to the grid, take up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Article 4.8.9 to 4.8.13. 
**4.15.9** If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the teams and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten car lengths behind it. As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line. No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 3.1.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. Each lap completed while the safety car is deployed will be counted as a race lap. 
**4.15.10** If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume racing at all, the message “RE-START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all teams via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The procedures set out in Articles 4.14 and 4.15.1-4.15.7 must then be followed and there will be no standing start. 
**4.15.11** If the race cannot be resumed the results will be taken at the end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given. 
### 4.16 Finish 
**4.16.1** A chequered light panel will be the end-of-race signal and will be shown at the Line as soon as the leading car has covered the full race distance in accordance with Article 3.1.3. 
**4.16.2** Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given. Should the end-ofrace signal be delayed for any reason, the race will be deemed to have finished when it should have finished. 
**4.16.3** After receiving the end-of-race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post-race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary). 
 An exception to Article 4.1.4 and to the above will be made for the winning driver who may perform an act of celebration before reaching parc fermé, provided any such act: a. Is performed safely and does not endanger other drivers or any officials. b. Does not call into question the legality of his car. c. Does not delay the podium ceremony. Any classified car which cannot reach the post-race parc fermé under its own power will be placed under the exclusive control of the marshals who will take the car to the parc fermé. 
### 4.17 Classification 
**4.17.1** The car placed first will be the one having covered the scheduled distance in the shortest time, or, where appropriate, passed the Line in the lead at the end of two hours (or more under Article 3.1.3). All cars will be classified taking into account the number of complete laps they have covered, and for those which have completed the same number of laps, the order in which they crossed the Line. 
**4.17.2** Cars having covered less than 90% of the number of laps covered by the winner (rounded down to the nearest whole number of laps), will not be classified. 
**4.17.3** The official classification will be published after the race. It will be the only valid result subject to any amendments which may be made under the International Sporting Code and the Sporting Regulations. 
## ARTICLE 5: OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND LIMITATIONS DURING A 
## COMPETITION 
### 5.1 Scrutineering 
**5.1.1** Each competitor will be required to carry out initial scrutineering of his cars and submit the duly completed declaration no later than 1.5 hours before the start of P1. The declaration form template may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. 
**5.1.2** Unless a waiver is granted by the stewards, competitors who do not keep to these time limits will not be allowed to take part in the Competition. 
**5.1.3** No car may take part in the Competition until the declaration described in Article 5.1.1 above has been submitted, and the FIA technical delegate has confirmed to the competitor that he is satisfied it has been fully and correctly completed. 
**5.1.4** Any competitor whose car has a change of survival cell after initial scrutineering (see Article 5.1.1 above) must complete a new declaration for approval by the FIA technical delegate. However, any such car may not be used until the following day. 
**5.1.5** The bodywork (excluding radiators) of each car as presented for initial scrutineering will establish the Reference Specification and the car must be returned to this before the start of P3. The procedure to establish conformity with this article is described in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. 
**5.1.6** The scrutineers may: 
 a. Check the eligibility of a car or of a competitor at any time during a Competition. b. Require a car to be dismantled by the competitor to make sure that the conditions of eligibility or conformity are fully satisfied. c. Require a competitor to pay the reasonable expenses which exercise of the powers mentioned in this Article may entail. d. Require a competitor to supply them with such parts or samples as they may deem necessary. 
**5.1.7** The race director or the clerk of the course may require that any car involved in an accident be stopped and checked. 
**5.1.8** Checks and scrutineering shall be carried out by duly appointed officials who shall also be responsible for the operation of the parc fermé and who alone are authorised to give instructions to the competitors. 
**5.1.9** The stewards will publish the findings of the scrutineers each time cars are checked during the Competition. These results will not include any specific figure except when a car is found to be in breach of the Technical Regulations. 
### 5.2 Weighing 
**5.2.1** After any free practice session or during the qualifying practice session cars will be weighed as follows: a. When signalled to do so the driver will proceed directly to the FIA garage and stop his engine. 
 Any driver who fails to stop when asked to do so, and then fails to bring the car back to the FIA garage, or if work is carried out on the car before it is returned to the FIA garage, will be referred to the stewards. b. At the end of the qualifying session all cars which took part in Q3 will be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car. c. If a car stops on the circuit during the qualifying session and the driver leaves the car, he must go to the FIA garage immediately on his return to the pit lane in order for his weight to be established. 
**5.2.2** After the race any classified car may be weighed. If a driver wishes to leave his car before it is weighed he must ask the technical delegate to weigh him in order that this weight may be added to that of the car. 
**5.2.3** The relevant car may be disqualified should its weight be less than that specified in Article 4.1 of the Technical Regulations when weighed under (a) or (b) above, save where the deficiency in weight results from the accidental loss of a component of the car. 
**5.2.4** No substance may be added to, placed on, or removed from a car after it has been selected for weighing or has finished the race or during the weighing procedure. (Except by a scrutineer when acting in his official capacity). 
**5.2.5** In the event of any breach of these provisions for the weighing of cars the stewards may drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider appropriate or disqualify him from the race. 
### 5.3 Refuelling 
**5.3.1 General provisions** 
 a. Refuelling is only permitted in the team’s designated garages. b. Fuel may not be added to nor removed from a car after it has left the pit lane to start the first reconnaissance lap permitted under Article 4.8.1. 
**5.3.2** No car may be refuelled, nor may fuel be removed from a car, at a rate greater than 0.8 litres per second. 
**5.3.3** The driver may remain in his car throughout refuelling but the engine must be stopped. 
**5.3.4** During all refuelling or fuel handling operations: 
 a. The relevant personnel must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA Standard 8867-2016 or FIA Standard 8856-2000. b. An assistant equipped with a suitable fire extinguisher of appropriate capacity must be present and must be wearing outer garments which are in compliance with either FIA Standard 8867-2016 or FIA Standard 8856-2000. c. All cars, refuelling equipment and containers must be suitably grounded where necessary. d. Any powered pumping system used to transfer fuel must be operated by a non-latching switch or be turned off automatically if the operator leaves. 
### 5.4 Pre-Race Parc Fermé 
**5.4.1** Every team must provide the FIA technical delegate with a suspension set-up sheet for both of their cars before each of them leaves the pit lane for the first time during qualifying 
**5.4.2** Each car will be deemed to be in parc fermé from the time at which it leaves the pit lane for the first time during P3 until the start of the race. From this point, all cars must be presented in their 
 Reference Specification. Any car which fails to leave the pit lane during P3 will be deemed to be in parc fermé at the end of P3. From this point until the start of qualifying the following work may be carried out: a. Engines may be started. b. Wheels, wheel fasteners and tyres may be removed, changed or rebalanced and tyre pressures adjusted. c. Spark plugs may be removed in order to carry out an internal engine inspection and cylinder compression checks. d. Permitted breather, heating or cooling devices may be fitted. e. A jump battery may be connected and on board electrical units may be freely accessed via a physical connection to the car. f. Charging and / or discharging of the ERS energy storage devices. g. Compressed gases may be drained or added. h. Fluids may be drained, bled and/or replenished, however, fluids used for replenishment must conform to the same specification as the original fluid. i. The aerodynamic set up of the front wing may be adjusted using the existing parts. No parts may be added, removed or replaced. j. If the FIA technical delegate is satisfied that changes in climatic conditions necessitate alterations to the specification of a car, changes may be made to the air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts. These changes may be made at any time after all teams have been sent the message “CHANGE IN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS” via the official messaging system. From this point onwards the choice of air ducts around the front and rear brakes and radiator ducts is free and pitot tubes may be covered or uncovered, subject always to compliance with the relevant Technical Regulations. k. Bodywork (excluding primary heat exchangers) may be removed l. Cosmetic changes may be made to the bodywork and tape may be added. m. Any part of the car may be cleaned. n. On board cameras, marshalling system components, timing transponders and any associated equipment may be removed, refitted or checked. o. Any work required by the FIA technical delegate. p. Changes to improve the driver's comfort. In this context anything other than the adjustment of mirrors, seat belts and pedals may only be carried out with the specific permission of the FIA technical delegate. Should ambient temperature change significantly, teams will be requested to change the head padding required by Article 12.6.1-6 of the Technical Regulations via the official messaging system. The addition or removal of padding (or similar material) is also permitted but may only be carried out under supervision and, if required by the FIA technical delegate, must be removed before the post-race weighing procedure. q. Drinking fluid for the driver may be added at any time, however, the capacity of the container for any such fluid must not exceed 1.5 litres. r. Repair of genuine accident damage. 
 s. Any parts which are removed from the car in order to carry out any work specifically permitted above, or any parts removed to carry out essential safety checks, must remain close to it and, at all times, be visible to the scrutineer assigned to the relevant car. Furthermore, any parts removed from the car in order to carry out any such work must be refitted before the car leaves the pit lane. In addition to the above, from the time at which each car leaves the pit lane for the first time in P3 until the time it leaves the pit lane for the first time in qualifying (or failing that the end of Q1), the following work may be carried out: t. Suspension elements as described in Article 10.4.2 and 10.4.3 of the Technical Regulations may be changed, as well as any adjustment made to suspension components defined in Article 10.3 of the Technical Regulations with the aim to adjust camber, toe or ride height. u. Weight distribution may be altered. v. Engine and gearbox cooling may be adjusted by altering the apertures described in Article 3.7.6 (b) and (c) of the Technical Regulations. w. Brake ducts as described in Article 3.13 of the Technical Regulations may be changed. x. The aerodynamic set up of the rear wing may be changed in order to achieve the necessary level of Aerodynamic Drag. In order to do so, it is permissible to change all the components of the Rear Wing, as defined in Article 3.10 of the Technical Regulations. However, below Z=650 these changes may only entail components which have the same Aerodynamic surfaces to the components that are being replaced, with the exception of the Gurney of the Rear Wing Beam. Additionally, the Competitor should be able to demonstrate to the FIA, if requested, that the replaced components are required for the purposes of adjusting Aerodynamic Drag, and not as part of experimentation or development. 
**5.4.3** Any work not listed above may only be undertaken with the approval of the FIA technical delegate following a written request from the team concerned. It must be clear that any replacement part a team wishes to fit is the same in design and similar in mass, inertia and function to the original. Any parts removed will be retained by the FIA. However, if a team wishes to change a part during P3, the qualifying session, between reconnaissance laps and/or on the grid before the start of the race, this may be done without first seeking the permission of the technical delegate, provided it is reasonable for the relevant team to believe permission would be given if there was time to ask and the broken or damaged part remains in full view of the scrutineer assigned to the car at all times. 
**5.4.4** At the end of the qualifying practice at least six cars will be chosen at random to undergo further checks, once informed their car has been selected the team concerned must take the car to the parc fermé immediately. 
**5.4.5** In order to ensure that they remain secure until the following day, all cars must be covered and ready for FIA seals to be applied during the following times: a. The period that commences three hours following the end of P2 and finishes at the end of the second restricted period in accordance with article 5.10.2b. b. The period that commences three and a half hours following the end of Qualifying and finishes in accordance with article 5.4.6. For marketing purposes these deadlines may be extended on a case by case basis for one car from each competitor by prior arrangement with the FIA technical delegate. However, during such exceptions, no work of any kind may be carried out on the car. Whilst cars are covered overnight they may be fitted with devices to keep them warm. 
**5.4.6** Five hours and 10 minutes before the start of the formation lap the seals and covers may be removed but the cars will remain under parc fermé conditions until the start of the race. 
**5.4.7** A competitor may not modify any part on the car or make changes to the set-up of the suspension whilst the car is being held under parc fermé conditions. In the case of a breach of this Article the relevant driver must start the race from the pit lane and follow the procedures laid out in Article 4.8.2. In order that the scrutineers may be completely satisfied that no alterations have been made to the suspension systems or aerodynamic configuration of the car (with the exception of the front wing) whilst in pre-race parc fermé, it must be clear from physical inspection that changes cannot be made without the use of tools. 
**5.4.8** One scrutineer will be allocated to each car for the purpose of ensuring that no unauthorised work is carried out whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions. 
**5.4.9** A list of parts replaced with the specific agreement of the FIA technical delegate whilst cars are being held under parc fermé conditions will be published and distributed to all teams prior to the race. 
**5.4.10** The mass of oil contained in each oil tank, with the exception of the main oil tank, must be declared to the FIA one hour before the start of the race. 
### 5.5 Post-Race Parc Fermé 
**5.5.1** Only those officials charged with supervision may enter the post-race parc fermé. No intervention of any kind is allowed there unless authorised by such officials. 
**5.5.2** When the parc fermé is in use, parc fermé regulations will apply in the area between the Line and the parc fermé entrance. 
**5.5.3** The parc fermé shall be secured such that no unauthorised persons can gain access to it. 
### 5.6 Spare Cars 
**5.6.1** Each competitor may have no more than two cars available for use at any one time during a Competition. 
**5.6.2** Any driver whose car has a change of survival cell following the start of the third free practice session (P3) must start the race from the pit lane following the procedures detailed in Article 4.8.2. Under these circumstances the car concerned will not have to comply with the requirements of Article 5.4. 
### 5.7 Power Unit usage 
**5.7.1** The only power units that may be used at a Competition during the 2021-2025 Championship seasons are either: a. A power unit which is constituted only of elements that were in conformity, at the date they were introduced in the race pool, with the latest submitted and approved homologation dossier as defined in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations, or b. A power unit previously homologated during the 2014-2020 period. Any manufacturer who homologated a power unit during this period may apply to the FIA to re-use such a power unit in a given team without going through the re-homologation process described in Appendix 4 of the Technical Regulations. Any such power units must be in conformity with the latest homologation dossier submitted to the FIA for that particular power unit for that season save for differences in parts agreed by the FIA at its absolute discretion to be solely associated with power unit installation with different teams, provided such differences have no significant effect on car performance. The 
 homologation dossier must be updated with these differences. The FIA must be satisfied, at its absolute discretion, that such a power unit could fairly and equitably be allowed to compete with other homologated power units. 
**5.7.2** Unless he drives for more than one team (see Article 5.7.4(c) below), and subject to the additions described below, each driver may use no more than 3 engines (ICE), 3 motor generator unitsheat (MGU-H), 3 turbochargers (TC), 2 energy stores (ES), 2 control electronics (CE) 2 motor generator units-kinetic (MGU-K) and 8 sets of Engine exhaust systems during a Championship season. _Note: These numbers will be reviewed according to the number of races per championship season and added into the table in Article 5.8.2 or to a similar one_ With the consent of (and at the sole discretion of) the FIA, the numbers above will be increased by one for any driver using a power unit provided by a new power unit manufacturer (as defined in Appendix 4) taking part in their first Championship season. 
**5.7.3** Should a driver use more Power Unit elements than the numbers set in Article 5.7.2 of any one of the elements during a Championship season, a grid place penalty will be imposed upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used. Penalties will be applied according to the following table and will be cumulative: a. The first time an additional element is used: Ten grid place penalty. b. The next times an additional element is used: Five grid place penalty. Any of the six elements will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane. During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same power unit element which is subject to penalties, only the last element fitted may be used at subsequent Competitions without further penalty. 
**5.7.4** If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship season his replacement will be deemed to be the original driver for the purposes of assessing power unit usage. 
**5.7.5** After consultation with the relevant power unit supplier the FIA will attach seals to each of the relevant elements of the power unit prior to them being used for the first time at a Competition in order to ensure that no significant moving parts can be rebuilt or replaced. Within two hours of the end of the post-race parc fermé additional seals will be applied to all used power unit elements in order to ensure that they cannot be run or dismantled between Competitions. The sealing method must be agreed with the FIA technical delegate. Upon request to the FIA these additional seals will be removed 24 hours before the start of the next Competition at which the power unit elements are required. All such power unit elements must remain within the team’s designated garage area when not fitted to a car and may not be started at any time during a Competition other than when fitted to a car eligible to participate in the Competition. If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from the relevant components within the power unit after they have been used for the first time those parts may not be used again unless they were removed under FIA supervision. 
### 5.8 Usage of Restricted-Number Components (RNC) 
**5.8.1** Restricted-Number Components (RNC) are components which have a limitation in numbers that can be used by each driver in a Competition over a Championship Season. 
**5.8.2** For each RNC, each driver may use up to a maximum number of such elements in a Championship Season, and this maximum value for this RNC will vary as a function of the Competitions in that Season, in accordance to the table of this Article. 
 Should a driver use more than the allowable maximum value of elements for a given RNC, a grid penalty will be imposed upon him at the first Competition during which each additional element is used. Penalties will vary between the first time an additional RNC is used, or the subsequent times, in accordance with the relevant columns of the table of this Article. Any additional RNC will be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane.

 The following exceptions and provisions apply: a. RNCs may be subjected to maintenance or repair work between Competitions provided that: i. The nature of the work to be carried out has been approved by the FIA and communicated to all Competitors ii. The Competitor takes all the necessary measures to satisfy the FIA that the provisions of this Article are fully respected. This may include, but is not limited to, an accurate record of the repair work that gets carried out, photographs, the recording pf part numbers, etc. b. No significant parts of an RNC may be replaced between Competitions, unless expressly permitted by the FIA. c. With the consent of (and at the sole discretion of) the FIA, the numbers above will be increased in accordance with the relevant column of the table above, if: i. The RNC used is supplied by a new Power Unit Manufacturer (as defined in Appendix 4) for Power Unit RNC’s ii. The Competitor in question is participating in their first Championship Season d. If a driver is replaced at any time during the Championship Season his replacement will be deemed to be the original driver for the purposes of assessing the number of available RNC’s. 
 e. During any single Competition, if a driver introduces more than one of the same RNC which is subject to penalties, only the last such element fitted may be used at subsequent Competitions without further penalty. f. Penalties applied under the provisions of this Article are cumulative and apply only to the Competition where they have been incurred. 
**5.8.3** For each RNC, the FIA will determine the appropriate method of identification in order to ensure that the provisions of Article 5.8.2 are fully met. This may involve the usage of seals, the scanning of part numbers, the use of appropriate containers which can be sealed between Competitions or any other solution that the FIA decides, duly communicated to the Competitors. Any seals used will be attached after consultation with the relevant Competitor or Power Unit supplier. If any of the FIA seals are damaged or removed from an RNC after it has been used for the first time this RNC may not be used again unless the seals were removed under FIA supervision. 
### 5.9 Covers of components during a Competition 
 Twenty four hours before the Competition begins, no screen, cover or other obstruction which in any way obscures any part of a car will be allowed at any time in the paddock, garages, pit lane or grid, unless it is clear any such covers are needed solely for mechanical reasons, which could, for example, include protecting against fire. In addition to the above the following are specifically not permitted: a. Engine, gearbox or radiator covers whilst engines are being changed or moved around the garage. b. Covers over spare wings when they are on a stand in the pit lane not being used. c. Parts such as (but not limited to) spare floors, fuel rigs or tool trolleys may not be used as an obstruction. The following are permitted: d. Covers which are placed over damaged cars or components. e. A transparent tool tray, no more than 50mm deep, placed on top of the rear wing. f. Warming or heat retaining covers for the engine and gearbox on the grid. g. A rear wing cover designed specifically to protect a mechanic starting the car from fire. h. Covers over the tyre manufacturer’s code numbers (not the FIA bar code numbers). i. A cover over the car in the parc fermé overnight. j. A cover over the car in the pit lane or grid if it is raining. k. Tyre heating blankets as described in Article 12.7.3 of the Technical Regulations. 
### 5.10 Operational personnel during a Competition 
**5.10.1** From the start of the Competition until two hours after the start of the race no competitor may have more than a total of 60 team personnel who are associated in any way with the operation of the cars within the confines of the circuit. However, during the period starting 45 minutes before the start of the first formation lap until 15 minutes after the scheduled start of the race the number of such operational personnel is unlimited. For the avoidance of doubt staff whose duties are solely connected with hospitality, team motorhomes, sponsors, marketing, public relations, security or driving trucks to or from the Competition are not considered operational personnel. 
 In addition to the 60 personnel described above each competitor will be allowed six individual exceptions during a Championship season for trainee personnel, however, no individual trainee may attend more than two Competitions in this capacity. A list of all operational, exempt, trainee and single race personnel must be submitted to the FIA prior to each Competition using the official template that may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. 
**5.10.2** No team personnel who are associated in any way with the operation of the cars are permitted within the confines of the circuit during the following times: a. A thirteen hour period which commences seventeen hours before the scheduled start times of P1 b. A nine and a half hour period that commences twelve and a half hours before the scheduled start of P3. With the exception of Monaco, if the unrestricted time between the end of P2 and the start of the second restricted period exceeds five hours the excess will be added to the second restricted period. Each team will be permitted two individual exceptions to the above during a Championship season, however, both of these exceptions may not be used during a single Competition. For the avoidance of doubt, personnel whose duties are solely connected with catering, media or marketing are exempt from the above requirements. 
**5.10.3** Only twelve team members per competitor are allowed in the signalling area during practice and the race. 
### 5.11 Additional safety provisions during a Competition 
**5.11.1** The race director, the clerk of the course or the FIA medical delegate can require a driver to have a medical examination at any time during a Competition. If, after an incident, the Medical Warning Light signals that threshold forces have been exceeded the driver must be examined by the Competition’s medical service without delay, the FIA Medical Delegate will determine the most appropriate place for this examination. 
**5.11.2** The organiser must make at least two fire extinguishers of 5kg capacity available to each competitor and ensure that they work properly. 
**5.11.3** Unless authorised by the FIA no one under the age of 16 is allowed in the pit lane at the following times: a. The period commencing fifteen minutes prior to and ending five minutes after every practice session. b. The period commencing fifteen minutes before the pit exit is opened to allow cars to cover reconnaissance laps and the time when the last car enters the parc fermé after the race has ended. 
**5.11.4** Animals, except those which may have been expressly authorised by the FIA for use by security services, are forbidden on the track, in the pit lane, in the paddock or in any spectator area. 
## ARTICLE 6: TYRE LIMITATIONS 
### 6.1 Supply of tyres 
 The single tyre manufacturer (the Supplier) appointed by the FIA must undertake to provide: a. Three specifications of dry-weather tyre at each Competition, each of which must be visibly distinguishable from one another when a car is on the track. b. At certain Competitions one additional specification of dry-weather tyre may be made available to all teams for evaluation purposes following a recommendation to the FIA from the Supplier. Teams will be informed about such an additional specification at least one week before the start of the relevant Competition. c. One specification of intermediate tyre at each Competition. d. One specification of wet-weather tyre at each Competition. 
### 6.2 Quantity, selection and specification of tyres during a Competition 
 a. Except under Articles 6.1(b), 6.4(f) and 6.4(g), no driver may use more than thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres, four sets of intermediate tyres and three sets of wet-weather tyres during a Competition. A complete set of tyres will be deemed to comprise two front and two rear tyres all of which must be of the same specification and as allocated by the FIA, however, sets of the same specification may be mixed following the qualifying practice session. b. No less than nine weeks before the start of each Competition held in Europe, and fifteen weeks before the start of each Competition held outside Europe, the FIA will provide all competitors with the following information relevant to the Competition in question: i. Which tyre specifications will be made available by the Supplier. ii. The mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification(s) (up to two). iii. The mandatory dry-weather Q3 tyre specification (which will always be the softest of the three specifications). Competitors must then inform the FIA, no less than eight weeks before the start of each Competition held in Europe and fourteen weeks before the start of each Competition held outside Europe, which specifications of dry-weather tyres they wish to use for each of their drivers at the Competition. From the thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres available to each driver: i. At least two sets must be of the mandatory race tyre specification(s). For the avoidance of doubt, if there are two mandatory race tyre specifications, one of each must be chosen. ii. At least one set must be of the mandatory Q3 tyre specification. iii. The remaining sets may be chosen from the available tyre specifications. Once the FIA has been provided with this information by all competitors the Supplier will be informed. If a competitor fails to provide the above information before the deadline the FIA will allocate tyre specifications to any driver concerned as it deems appropriate. If any of the above deadlines fall within the shutdown period described in Article 9.2.1 the FIA, in consultation with the Supplier, will provide competitors with revised dates. In no case will any date be moved by more than two weeks. 
 c. Once the above selections have been made the FIA technical delegate will allocate sets of tyres to each driver from among the stock of tyres the Supplier makes available for the Competition. d. In exceptional circumstances. the deadlines defined in Article 6.2 (b) may be delayed by up to two weeks at the FIA’s absolute discretion. Conditions that may warrant such a decision include but are not limited to circuit layout changes, circuit surfacing changes, etc. e. In the event the tyre specifications for a certain Championship Season are significantly different to those of the previous one, the selection of the tyres, as defined in (b) above, for the first five Competitions of the Championship Season will be made by the FIA, in consultation with the tyre supplier, and will be the same for all Competitors. The decision to implement this clause will be to the FIAs absolute discretion. 
### 6.3 Control of tyres 
 a. The outer sidewall of all tyres which are to be used at a Competition must be marked with a unique identification. b. Other than in cases of force majeure (accepted as such by the stewards), all tyres intended for use at a Competition must be presented to the FIA technical delegate for allocation prior to the start of the Competition. c. At any time during a Competition, and at his absolute discretion, the FIA technical delegate may select alternative dry-weather tyres to be used by any team or driver from among the stock of tyres the appointed supplier has present at the Competition. d. A competitor wishing to replace one unused tyre by another identical unused one must present both tyres to the FIA technical delegate. e. The use of tyres without appropriate identification may result in a grid position penalty or disqualification from the race. 
### 6.4 Use of tyres 
 The official return of tyres will be made electronically in accordance with the procedure described within the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. Any set of electronically returned tyres must also be physically returned to the Supplier before the start of the following session. a. All tyres must be operated in accordance with the prescriptions issued prior to each Competition by the FIA and the procedures set out in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. b. In accordance to Article 10.8.4 of the Technical Regulations, any process or device which is intended to increase the temperature of the tyres is forbidden, with the exception of the tyre blankets defined in Articles 10.8.4 (d) and 10.8.5 of the Technical Regulations. The FIA reserves the right to issue guidelines to ensure this requirement is being met. c. The only sets of tyres which may be used during a Competition are those which are defined in Article 6.2(a). Any driver who uses a set of tyres of differing specifications during the race may not complete more than three laps on this set before changing them for a set of tyres of the same specification. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who does not change tyres within three laps. For the avoidance of doubt, a set of tyres of differing specifications will not be considered when assessing the number of specifications used during the race. 
 d. Tyres will only be deemed to have been used once the car’s timing transponder has shown that it has left the pit lane. e. If an additional driver is used (see Article 3.12.2) he must use the tyres allocated to the nominated driver he replaced. f. If an additional specification of dry-weather tyre is made available in accordance with Article 6.1(b) two sets of these tyres will be allocated to each driver for use during P1 and P2. Any such tyres must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P2. g. If either P1 or P2 are declared wet one additional set of intermediate tyres will be made available to any driver who used a set of intermediate tyres during either session. Under such circumstances, one used set of intermediate tyres must be electronically returned before the start of the qualifying practice session. If neither P1 nor P2 are declared wet, but the likelihood of P3 being declared wet is deemed by the FIA to be high, one additional set of intermediate tyres will be made available to all drivers. Under such circumstances, one set of intermediate tyres must be electronically returned before the start of the qualifying practice session. h. From the thirteen sets of dry-weather tyres allocated to each driver under Article 6.2(c): i. One set of the mandatory Q3 tyre specification may not be used nor returned before Q3 and, for the cars that qualified for Q3, one set of the same specification must be electronically returned no later than three and a half hours after the end of Q3. ii. Two sets of the mandatory race specification(s) may not be returned before the race. For the avoidance of doubt, if there are two mandatory race tyre specifications, one set of each specification may not be returned before the race. From the ten remaining sets: iii. One set, which each competitor must nominate prior to the start of P1 (or may renominate with the consent of the FIA technical delegate), may only be used during the first 40 minutes of the session. If the session is stopped during the first 40 minutes the length of the stoppage will be added to the 40-minute limit. Should P1 be declared wet, use will be extended for the remainder of the session. This extension will only be available to drivers who have covered more than one installation lap on either an intermediate or wet tyre. iv. One further set must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P1. v. Two further sets must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P2 unless both P1 and P2 are either declared wet or cancelled, in which case one of these sets may be retained by each driver but must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P3. vi. Two further sets must be electronically returned no later than two hours after the end of P3. i. Once all tyres have been returned electronically after P2 and the qualifying practice session the Supplier will publish a list of the tyres which each driver has available to him for the remainder of the Competition. j. Prior to the start of the qualifying practice session intermediate and wet-weather tyres may only be used after the track has been declared wet by the race director, following which intermediate, wet or dry-weather tyres may be used for the remainder of the session. 
 k. With the exception of any cars that are required to start the race from the pitlane, at the start of the race each car which qualified for Q3 must be fitted with the tyres with which the driver set his fastest time during Q2. This will only be necessary for these cars if dryweather tyres were used to set the fastest time in Q2 and if dry-weather tyres are used at the start of the race. Any such tyres damaged during Q2 will be inspected by the FIA technical delegate who will decide, at his absolute discretion, whether any may be replaced and, if so, which tyres they should be replaced with. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver whose car is not fitted with the tyres with which he set his fastest time in Q2 (except if damaged tyres have been replaced with the approval of the FIA technical delegate). l. Unless he has used intermediate or wet-weather tyres during the race, each driver must use at least two different specifications of dry-weather tyres during the race, at least one of which must be a mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification as defined in Article 6.2(b). Unless a race is suspended and cannot be re-started, failure to comply with this requirement will result in the disqualification of the relevant driver from the race results. If the race is suspended and cannot be re-started, thirty seconds will be added to the elapsed time of any driver who was unable to use at least two specifications of dryweather tyre. m. If the formation lap is started behind the safety car because of heavy rain (see Article 4.8.14(c)), or the race resumed in accordance with Article 4.15.5(a), the use of wetweather tyres until the safety car returns to the pits is compulsory. A penalty under Article 4.11.3(d) will be imposed on any driver who does not use wet weather tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times. 
### 6.5 Testing of tyres 
 a. From the time at which each competitor receives fitted tyres from the Supplier at or before a Competition these may not be used on any rig, simulator or vehicle, other than the F1 car for which they were intended. b. Other than uniquely vertical forces, tyre rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, tyres supplied to any competitor at any time may not be used on any rig, device or vehicle (other than an F1 car on an F1 approved track, at the exclusion of any kind of road simulator), either Team owned or rented, providing measurements of forces and/or moments produced by a rotating full size F1 tyre, or any form of characterisation (excluding external geometric measurements) of physical aspects of the tyre or the compounds or materials from which the tyre is constructed.

The second and third drivers' awards must be presented by the President of the ASN, unless local circumstances require an additional dignitary to be present. In this case, the latter will present the second award and the ASN president the third. Should the ASN president be unavailable or presenting the winning driver's trophy, the master of ceremonies will select a suitable replacement. An invitation will be issued to each person attending the podium ceremony, with clear instructions as to the procedure to follow. 
**7.2.6 Scenario (indicative designs are available on request)** 
 a. Only three persons should be on the podium to present the trophies. In exceptional circumstances, the master of ceremonies may increase this to four. b. No police, bodyguards or persons not authorised by the master of ceremonies are allowed on the podium. 
 c. The master of ceremonies will inform the TV and public address commentator of the names of the persons presenting the trophies. d. The master of ceremonies must be on the side of the podium where the trophies are located. The persons presenting the trophies will be on the other side. The master of ceremonies will hand the trophies to those presenting them. 
**7.2.7 Television** 
 The ideal position for the TV camera is immediately opposite the podium and at the same height. Under no circumstances must there be a TV camera man on the podium. 
**7.2.8 Parc Fermé location** 
 The parc fermé must be positioned as close as possible to the podium, preferably immediately below, with direct access. As soon as all the cars have crossed the Line, a course car must go round the track to collect any driver who has finished in the first three but is stranded on the circuit. 
**7.2.9 Parc Fermé interviews** 
 Once the top three finishers have parked in the designated positions in parc fermé, they will follow the procedure set out in the Race Director’s note which will be issued prior to the race, as set out in Article 7.1.3. Each driver will be interviewed in the parc fermé area, before being taken by the FIA Media Delegate to the Cool Down Room, where they will be weighed by the FIA Technical Delegate before the podium ceremony begins. 
**7.2.10 Post-race media activities** 
 Once the podium ceremony has concluded, drivers will be taken by the FIA Media Delegate to conduct the media activities as defined in Article 7.1.3. 
**7.2.11 Water and towels** 
 3 bottles of water must be put in the parc fermé (no identification). 3 bottles of water must be put in the unilateral room (no identification). 3 towels must be available in the unilateral room. No other drinks are permitted in the parc fermé or unilateral room. 
### 7.3 Meetings 
 Meetings, chaired by the race director, will take place three hours before the start of P1 and one and a half hours following the end of P2. The first must be attended by all team managers and the second by all drivers. Should the race director consider another meeting necessary it will take place three hours before the start of the race. Competitors will be informed no later than three hours following the end of the qualifying practice session. All drivers and team managers must attend. 
### 7.4 Car livery 
**7.4.1** The provisions of the International Sporting Code relating to national colours shall not apply to the Championship. Both cars entered by a competitor must be presented in substantially the same livery at every Competition, any significant change to this livery during a Championship season may only be made with the agreement of the Formula One Commission. 
 In order that the cars of each team may be easily distinguished from one another whilst they are on the track, the on board cameras located above the principal roll structure of the first car must remain as it is supplied to the team and the second car must be predominantly fluorescent yellow. In order for drivers to be easily distinguished from one another whilst they are on the track, the crash helmet of each driver must, with the exception of one Competition of the driver’s choice, be presented in substantially the same livery at every Competition during a Championship season. A change to helmet livery will also be permitted if a driver changes team during a Championship season. 
**7.4.2** Each car will carry the race number of its driver as published by the FIA at the beginning of the season or the race number that has been allocated to his replacement under Article 3.12.2(c). This number must be clearly visible from the front of the car and on the driver’s crash helmet. Race numbers will be permanently allocated to drivers and must then be used during every Formula One World Championship Competition he takes part in throughout his career in Formula 
1. A driver’s career in Formula 1 will be deemed to have ended if he does not participate in a Competition for two entire consecutive Championship seasons. The only exception to this allocation process will be for the reigning World Champion who will have the option to use the number one. The number that was previously allocated to him will be reserved for him in subsequent seasons if he does not retain the title of World Champion. 
**7.4.3** The name or the emblem of the make of the car must appear on the front of the nose of the car and in either case be at least 25mm in its largest dimension. The name of the driver must appear on the external bodywork and be clearly legible. 
## ARTICLE 8: TRACK RUNNING OUTSIDE A COMPETITION 
### 8.1 Testing of Current Cars (TCC), Promotional and Demonstration Events (PE and DE) 
**8.1.1** Testing of Current Cars (TCC) shall be defined as any track running time, not part of an Event, in which a competitor entered in the Championship participates (or in which a third party participates on behalf of a competitor or a supplier of a homologated power unit), using cars which were designed and built in order to comply with the Formula One Technical Regulations of the Championship, or those of the preceding year’s or the following year’s Championships. No competitor may sell or make available any such car of the current year to any third party without the prior authorisation of the FIA. 
**8.1.2 Promotional Events (PE)** 
 Each competitor will also be permitted to carry out two Promotional Events (PE) with the above cars which will not be considered TCC.

### 8.2 Testing of Previous Cars (TPC) 
 Testing of Previous Cars (TPC) shall be defined as any track running time, not part of an Event, in which a competitor entered in the Championship participates (or in which a third party participates on behalf of a competitor or a supplier of a homologated power unit), using cars which were designed and built in order to comply with the Formula One Technical Regulations of any of the three calendar years falling immediately prior to the calendar year preceding the 
 Championship. No competitor may sell or make available any such car to any third party without the prior authorisation of the FIA. TPC may only be carried out with cars built to the specification of the period and only tyres manufactured specifically for this purpose may be used. Each competitor will also be permitted to carry out Demonstration Events (DE) with the above cars which will not be considered TPC. A DE shall be defined as an event in which a competitor participates purely for demonstration purposes. No such demonstrations may exceed 50km in length and only tyres manufactured specifically for this purpose by the appointed supplier may be used. Should a competitor wish to run a DE in excess of 50km they must seek the consent of the FIA in writing prior to the event. In order that an FIA observer may be appointed, where possible competitors must inform the FIA of any planned TPC or DE at least 72 hours before it is due to commence, the following information should be provided: a. The precise specification of the car(s) to be used. b. The name(s) of the driver(s) if known. c. The nature of the test. d. The date(s) and intended duration of the test. e. The purpose of the test. TPC may only take place on tracks currently holding an FIA Grade 1 or 1T licence. During all TPC, cars must be fitted with the FIA ECU required by Article 8.3 of the FIA Formula One Technical Regulations. 
### 8.3 Testing of Historic Cars (THC) 
 Testing of Historic Cars (THC) shall be defined as any track running time, not part of an Event, in which a competitor entered in the Championship participates (or in which a third party participates on behalf of a competitor), using cars which were designed and built in order to comply with the Formula One Technical Regulations in force during the years preceding those referred to in Article 8.2 above. THC may only be carried out with cars built to the specification of the period and only tyres manufactured specifically for this purpose, or tyres of the period, may be used. 
### 8.4 Safety requirements during TCC, TPC or PE 
 Competitors may only participate in TCC, TPC or PE using cars which: a. Comply with all the safety-related requirements of the F1 Technical Regulations. Minimal exceptions will be accepted for the sole purpose of test sensor installations, provided they do not compromise the safety of the driver, team personnel or marshals. Any such exceptions must be communicated to the FIA no less than a week before the TCC, PPC or PE. The FIA may, at its absolute discretion deem such a design to be unsafe and request for the modification to be taken off the car. b. Have been subjected to, and fulfilled all the requirements of the static and dynamic tests described in the F1 Technical Regulations of the relevant year. If, after an incident during TCC and TPC, the Medical Warning Light signals that threshold forces have been exceeded the driver must present himself for examination in the circuit medical centre without delay. 
### 8.5 Available opportunities for TCC 
 TCC may only take place on tracks currently approved for use by Formula 1 cars and located in Europe (unless agreed by the majority of the competitors and the FIA), may never occur whilst a Championship Competition is taking place and shall be limited to: a. Two tests, open to all competitors, each of no more than three consecutive days’ duration,, carried out between 1 February and ten days before the start of the first Competition of the Championship. One day from any of these two tests may be set aside for testing of wet-weather tyres if requested by the appointed tyre supplier. Arrangements for this day of testing will be made in full consultation with all competitors and the FIA. b. One test, of three consecutive days’ duration carried out on the circuit at which the last Competition of the Championship was held, such test commencing no less than 36 hours after the end of the Competition. i. One or two days of this test must be completed by drivers who have participated in at least one race during the Formula 1 World Championship that has just been completed, and must be for the sole purpose of providing Competitors with the chance to test the tyre specifications to be used the following season. In the event that a Competitor is unable to provide a car that is compatible with such tyres, they will not be allowed to participate in this part day of testing. ii. One or two days of this test must be for the sole purpose of providing Young Drivers with the opportunity to test current Formula 1 Cars. Drivers eligible for this purpose must: 
- Be in possession of an International A Licence 
- Not have competed in more than two F1 World Championship races     during their career c. 25 car days of testing for the sole purpose of providing the appointed tyre supplier with the chance to test improvements to the design of their tyres, carried out between the end of the first Competition of the Championship and one week following the end of the last Competition of the Championship, organised by the FIA in consultation with all competitors and the appointed tyre supplier. Any such testing scheduled at a circuit hosting a Competition of the Championship may only be carried out after that Competition has taken place. The above tests will be organised by the FIA in consultation with all competitors and the appointed tyre supplier. The test schedule will be finalised within 21 days of the first publication of the Championship calendar, changes may only be made after this date with the agreement of all competitors. d. One day, carried out between the start of a ten day period which precedes the start of the second Competition and the last Competition of the Championship, in case a competitor declares that one of its current race drivers is to be substituted by a driver who has not participated in an F1 World Championship race in the two previous calendar years. The following must be observed: i. Any such day may only be carried out by the new driver and may not take place on a circuit hosting a race in the current Championship year. ii. Any such day may only take place within a period 14 days prior to the substitution and 14 days after the substitution has taken place. iii. If a competitor, having declared the driver’s substitution and performed the test, does not then enter a Competition with the new driver, the competitor will be 
 penalised by a reduction of one day from the pre-season TCC days available in the following year. With the exception of any test being carried out at night, in which case a new test schedule lasting no more than nine hours will be arranged, running may only take place between 9:00 and 18:00. In both cases each competitor may only use one car per day. 
### 8.6 Specific Requirements for TCC 
 a. Red flag and end-of-session procedures must be respected. b. The fuel handling procedures set out in Article 5.3.4 must be respected. c. No other type of vehicle is permitted on the track. d. Cars being driven by drivers who do not qualify for a Super Licence must be fitted with a green main rear light which must be illuminated at all times the car is on the track. e. Every reasonable effort should be made to ensure that the recommendations concerning emergency services detailed in Supplement 1 of Appendix H to the International Sporting Code are followed. 
## ARTICLE 9: OPERATIONAL REGULATIONS 
### 9.1 Purpose of this Article 
 The purpose of this Article is to control certain factory-based activities for cost-containing reasons. 
### 9.2 Summer Factory Shutdown 
**9.2.1** All competitors must observe a shutdown period of fourteen consecutive days during the time that two consecutive Competitions are separated by at least twenty four days during the months of July and/or August. If two consecutive Competitions during this period are separated by only eighteen days a shutdown period of thirteen consecutive days must be observed. In either case competitors should notify the FIA of their intended shutdown period within 30 days of the start of the championship season. During the shutdown period no team or affiliate to a team may carry out or instruct a third party supplier to carry out any of the following activities for or on behalf of the team: a. Operation or use of any wind tunnel (excluding any service and maintenance activity). b. Operation or use of any computer resource for Restricted CFD Simulations (excluding any service and maintenance activity). c. Production or development of wind tunnel parts, car parts, test parts or tooling. d. Sub-assembly of car parts or assembly of cars. e. Any work activity by any employee, consultant or sub-contractor engaged in design, development or production (excluding any work activity to be undertaken at the race track in preparation for the Competition immediately following the shutdown period). Each competitor must notify its suppliers of the dates of its shutdown period and must not enter into any agreement or arrangement with the intention of circumventing the prohibition on the above activities. 
**9.2.2** During the shutdown period the following activities will not be considered a breach of the above: 
 a. Repairs carried out with the agreement of the FIA to a car seriously damaged during the Competition preceding the shutdown period. b. The assembly and servicing of running or static show cars, none of which may entail the production, assembly or servicing of any current car parts. c. The operation and use of any wind tunnel or computer resource for Restricted CFD Simulations provided this is being carried out for projects with no direct relation to Formula One or for or on behalf of a competitor that is not at that time within its own shutdown period. d. Any activity the sole purpose of which is supporting projects unconnected to Formula One, subject to the written approval from the FIA. e. Any activity in relation to the power unit as defined in the Technical Regulations. 
**9.2.3 Shut down for PU manufacturers** 
 All PU manufacturers must observe the same shutdown period as the one described in article 9.2.1 with an exception for factories based in countries where law and/or unions impose a different closing week. In this case, these factories may replace one week out of two weeks of the shutdown period by the locally imposed week. PU manufacturers affected by this must make 
 a declaration to the FIA that their staff will not be permitted to transfer to work in the country that isn’t shutdown during these periods. During the shutdown period no occupancy hours nor operations hours may be incremented. 
### 9.3 Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR) 
 The ATR, and the definitions and rules which will apply to aerodynamic testing, are as follows: 
**9.3.1 General conditions** 
 a. Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a competitor and/or by any contracted party of a competitor or of any Associate of a competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor in a test environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub-component in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures or air flow direction resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow. b. The representation of an F1 car or sub-component subject to Restricted Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be considered for the purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry (RATG) and save for where specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to, removed from, morphed or modified. For the avoidance of doubt if the representation contains surfaces that represent more than one F1 car then it shall be construed as the equivalent number of RATGs. c. An Aerodynamic Testing Period (ATP) is a period of consecutive calendar weeks for the purposes of evaluation of the limits within this Article. As soon as one ATP ends a new one begins, with no gaps between them. There will be 6 ATPs in any year. The dates of these periods will be as follows: i. Period 1 will start on 1 January and finish at the end of week 9. ii. Period 2, 3 and 5 will run for exactly 8 weeks each. iii. Period 4 will run for 10 weeks, comprising the Summer Factory Shutdown described in Article 9.2 iv. Period 6 will end on the 31 December For the above definition, weeks are assumed to start on a Monday and week 1 is the first week of four days or more in the calendar year. d. In the context of this Article the words bodywork, sprung suspension and brake system air ducts will have the same definition as those provided by Article 3 of the F1 Technical Regulations. Any data acquired during Restricted Aerodynamic testing may only be available to the competitor that acquired it through use of the restricted aerodynamic testing available to it in accordance with the limits in this Article. 
**9.3.2 Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT)** 
 RWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the competitor to the FIA. Each competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve month period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be made no later than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a competitor. No re-nominations may be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility location, unique identification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used. The FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind tunnel already 
 nominated by a team suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of evaluating alternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility is changed or upgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier. For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor must take place in the wind tunnel nominated by the competitor. a. The limits for RWTT will be the number of runs of RWTT, the amount of wind tunnel occupancy time and wind tunnel wind-on time. i. During RWTT a single run will be deemed to commence each time the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s and will end the first time thereafter it falls below 5m/s. ii. During RWTT, once the wind tunnel air speed rises above 5m/s the RATG must remain fixed and unmodified until the wind tunnel air speed returns below 1m/s. iii. Between runs of RWTT detail changes to the RATG and model are permitted. b. Wind on time is defined as the amount of time in hours summed over the ATP, where the wind tunnel air speed exceeds 15m/s for RWTT. c. During RWTT, the first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s on a given calendar day, and will end at a time, declared by the competitor, when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the wind tunnel air speed is above 5m/s following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar day) and will end, either when the wind tunnel air speed falls below 5m/s for the last time on the same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress. Only two shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day. d. In the event of a demonstrated wind tunnel failure or other Force Majeure the FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, permitting additional occupancy to be used to compensate for that which is lost as a result. e. For the avoidance of doubt any RWTT performed for the competitor by any Associate of the competitor and/or by any contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to the competitor during an ATP will be subject to these same limits as if the tests were performed by the competitor. 
**9.3.3 RWTT Permitted technology** 
 The following restrictions apply during RWTT: a. Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are permitted. Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the yaw axis, designs which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the RATG are not permitted., For closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical walls and the ceiling to improve air flow uniformity is permitted. b. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s measured relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind tunnel testing the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured relative to the scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s². The rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed and smoothed using a moving 
 average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds during each wind tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are defined as the periods when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% of the maximum wind tunnel air speed during a run. c. Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used, and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance of doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors. d. The only permitted degrees of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of RWTT are: i. Wheel rotation about the wheel axis ii. Changes of ride height and roll angle relative to the ground plane and associated articulation of the elements representing the RATG suspension iii. Changes of load applied to wheels through the elements representing the RATG suspension iv. Steering of the front wheels v. Changes of yaw angle relative to the incident air flow vi. Simulation of differing exhaust flow vii. Adjustment of the flap angle of the front wing viii. Adjustment of the incidence of the rearmost and uppermost element of the top rear wing ix. Adjustment or operation of sensors e. Changes of attitude of the model and RATG may not occur at a rate that requires changes of ride height at the front or rear axle centreline greater than the scale equivalent of 0.033 m/s on the full size F1 car and/or rotation about the yaw or roll axes at a rate greater than 1.0 deg./s. f. Where non-rigid wind tunnel tyres are used for RWTT these may only be produced by the nominated tyre supplier. Furthermore, devices that actively modify the shape of the tyre during RWTT other than as a result of vertical and lateral loads reacted at the contact patch are not permitted. Tyre pressure control is permitted but the complete wheel must contain only a single fixed internal gas volume. 
**9.3.4 Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations** 
 RCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a competitor or any Associate of a competitor and/or by any contracted party of a competitor or of any Associate of a competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor of flows that are gaseous in the case of a F1 car and are not classified as power unit simulations. Any simulation of flows contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication systems, air, air/fuel mixtures, combustion process or products of combustion from a boundary commencing at the power unit’s atmospheric air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will be classified as a power unit simulation. For the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation defined above) reveals information to a competitor or to an Associate of the competitor whether directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor, about flows that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For example, any CFD simulations conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non-gaseous fluids are still RCFDs as they reveal information about flows that are gaseous on the full size F1 car. 
 a. A RCFDs refers to the pre-processing, the solver part or parts of the simulation process, and the post processing of the results of the simulation. i. Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the simulation. ii. Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the equations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or simulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not limited, to adjoint computation). iii. Post processing refers to the generation of representations of the flow solution that require numerical processing, for example but not limited to the computation of pressure coefficients, velocity, shear stress, flow streamlines or vorticity. Generation of videos or images displaying this information and any form or application of machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence (AI) based on simulation results is included in this definition. b. During or prior to RCFDs only changes to the attitude of the RATG, (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence are permitted. Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, initialisation and boundary conditions are allowed provided none of these are intended to circumvent the requirements of this Article by otherwise creating the effect of a change to the RATG. The solver part or parts of all RCFDs must only be carried out using a compute resource that contains a set of homogeneous processing units and that has been nominated by the competitor to the FIA. Each competitor must declare to the FIA in writing the compute resources that are employed for the purpose of the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations. Floating, fixed point and integer operations from the solver part or parts of RCFD simulations must only run on and may not be offloaded from these CPU cores. c. The declaration of a compute resource by the competitor to the FIA must include : i. The computer or cluster identification, manufacturer, model and location and the manufacturer, name and full unique model number of the Processing Units. ii. Number of processing unit cores in the compute resource. iii. Processor speed at which each Processing Unit is configured to run at 100% CPU load (CCF). In order to prevent deliberate underclocking this value may not be lower than the standard or base clock frequency given by the Manufacturer’s specification. Any specification of compute resource declared must be available on a non-exclusive basis to all competitors. d. If the compute resource is changed or upgraded then a new declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier. Such changes might include, but are not limited to, a change of the hardware specification, addition or removal of processing units or change of location of any part of the compute resource. e. The amount of compute resource used for the solve part or parts of all RCFDs shall be measured in Mega Allocation Unit hours (MAUh) and will be calculated as follows. 
AUh = (NCU * NSS * CCF) / 3600 
Where : 
AUh = The total number of Unit hours allocated to a CFD solver run. An Allocation Unit hour represents the use of a unit of resource allocation for one hour (and 1 x 
 MAUh = 1,000,000 x AUh). An Allocation Unit hour is equivalent to a core hour on a physical CPU core. 
CCF = Peak Processing Unit clock frequency in GigaHertz achieved during the CFD solver run. This will be the peak frequency theoretically achievable during the run based on one of the following : 
i) The standard or base clock frequency value from the Processing Unit Manufacturer’s specification (if overclocking or enhanced modes are not used in the run). 
ii) The maximum “turbo”, “HPC” or other enhanced mode frequency value. 
iii) The maximum overclocked frequency value. 
NCU = Number of Processing Unit cores used for the solver run. The effects of multithreading, where simultaneous threads run on the same physical core will be ignored. NSS = Number of solver wall clock seconds elapsed during the run. Message passing time during calculation must also be included. All information required for auditing of this calculation must be present in the output from the run including the CCF value. f. Non-RCFDs can be made by a competitor for the purpose of optimising CFD methodology, provided they use a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago and are carried out using only the nominated compute resources described above. This RATG may not be changed, added to, removed from, morphed or modified. For the avoidance of doubt, any Non-RCFDs carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the competitor or of any Associate of the competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a competitor must also be carried out using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD by the competitor more than 30 months ago. g. In the case of Non-RCFDs using a unique RATG which has been simulated in CFD more than 30 months ago geometry manipulations (e.g. in CAD clean-up or meshing software) having the sole purpose of reproducing exactly the same geometry previously solved in CFD (to a tolerance of 1.5mm scaled to a 1:1 car) are allowed. This tolerance is introduced only to allow for unintentional and incidental changes in geometry detail caused by the revisions in software and process. For the avoidance of doubt, static changes to car attitude (ride height, roll, yaw, steer and associated tyre shape or contact patch) and front wing flap angle or rear wing rearmost and uppermost element incidence are permitted. Modifications to surface and volume mesh resolution and type as well as the extent of the far field domain including changing the simulation between a wind tunnel or track environment, are allowed. h. The limits for RCFDs will be revised periodically, to take account of advances in CFD simulations. 
**9.3.5 Exceptions to the Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions (ATR)** 
 a. Any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car at any Competition or any aerodynamic test conducted by an F1 car during and at track testing as defined by Article 10 of the F1 Sporting Regulations will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing. b. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of power unit heat exchangers that reject heat to air, or the running of the power unit from a boundary commencing at the power unit air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of the exhaust system will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing, provided that 
 there is no direct or indirect measurement of aerodynamic force during the test. In this context, pressure and flow measurements within a duct shall not be considered to be measurements of aerodynamic force. c. Steady state and dynamic engine dynamometer work with an F1 car or subcomponent will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing provided that : i. The bodywork used in the test has no front wing assembly (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) or rear wing assembly (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) present. ii. No devices designed to measure directly, or indirectly aerodynamic forces or flow field characteristics are installed in the facility used. iii. No sensor installed on the car or subcomponent which are capable of measuring displacements, pressures or air flow direction of the external airstream resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow may be logged. Logging files have to be available, if required, during the independent audit inspection. iv. The gas flow exiting from the exhaust system is ducted away from the testing area before impacting on any bodywork component (other than the exhaust itself). d. Wind tunnel testing solely for the development of brake systems, wheels and tyres (Article 11 of the F1 Technical Regulations), and for development and calibration of pressure sensing instrumentation (such as pitot tubes, multi-directional probes and Kiel tubes), provided such tests do not concurrently test, or in any way provide incidental data or knowledge on, the performance or endurance of parts or systems classified as bodywork will not be considered as Restricted Aerodynamic testing. e. Wind tunnel testing that uses a RATG for the sole purpose of the conditioning of wind tunnel infrastructure or the development of wind tunnel infrastructure (including all of its sub-systems such as rolling road, model motion system, force balance, wind tunnel model spine, sensors etc.) and methodology may be performed and will not count towards the accumulation of runs, wind-on time, and occupancy subject to the testing complying with either of the following restrictions : i. The front wing group (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) and the rear wing group (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) of the RATG must be removed from the wind tunnel for the duration of the testing or both must be fitted with bluff covers that have been approved for this purpose by the FIA. ii. A RATG is used which is more than 12 months old, and that no modification is made to this previously tested RATG. During audit competitors may be requested to demonstrate compliance of any such testing through the production of supporting data. For the avoidance of doubt, any wind tunnel testing to develop bodywork parts other than as referred to above even without aerodynamic force measurement is within the definition of Restricted Aerodynamic testing. 
**9.3.6 Limits, Reporting, Inspection and Audit** 
 a. The limits for RWTT and RCFDs are as set out in the table below: 
 Maximum value in any ATP Units for 2021 for 20222025 
 RWTT Runs # 400 320 
 RWTT Wind On Time hours 100 80 
 RWTT Occupancy hours 500 400 
 Three-dimensional RATGs used for solve or solve part of all RCFDs 
#### # 2000 2000 
 Compute used for solve part or parts of all RCFDs 
 MAUh 6.0 6.0 
 b. Each competitor shall report to the FIA details of its RWTT and RCFDs for the preceding ATP within 14 days of the end of that ATP. The data must be provided in the exact format specified by the FIA, details of which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations. c. Digital wind tunnel image files in colour and with sufficient unobstructed field of view of the wind tunnel working section to include the entire model must be recorded, referenced to other data collected and a copy saved including a unique time stamp to at least one second accuracy for the start of each individual run. d. Should the FIA wish to access the images for inspection at any time they must be of adequate quality such that it is possible to use them to verify, for example, whether the front wing group (described in Article 3.9 of the F1 Technical Regulations) and rear wing group (described in Article 3.10 of the F1 Technical Regulations) are fitted. In the case of other runs deemed to be non-RWTT in the context of this Article, for example using a RATG greater than 12 months old, or using the approved wing covers, the images must also provide a clear visual reference to assist in verifying this aspect of the test. e. The complete surface mesh subject to the solver part or parts of each RCFD must be recorded and stored for a period of at least 24 months or until an earlier deletion is agreed by the FIA, referenced to all data relating to the RCFDs including but not limited to solution monitoring data and clearly and uniquely identifiable. It must be possible from these data to verify any changes made to the RCFDs and identify each individual flow solution generated using it. f. In order to verify the Restricted Aerodynamic testing facilities employed by the competitors and as a means of assuring common application of the restrictions set out in this Article, the FIA will arrange for independent benchmarking inspections of both wind tunnel and CFD activities to be carried out from time to time. Recommendations arising from these inspections will be incorporated into this Article. g. Failure to comply with the limits of the ATR by a competitor will result in a reduction of the limits that will apply to subsequent ATP or ATPs for that competitor at the FIA’s absolute discretion but by a minimum reduction equivalent to 10 multiples of the amount by which the relevant limit or limits were exceeded without prejudice to further appropriate action. (For example, if a competitor carries out 325 restricted wind tunnel runs against a maximum of 320 in an ATP, that competitor shall only be permitted to make 270 restricted wind tunnel runs during the next ATP). 
**9.3.7 Movement of personnel** 
 No competitor may use movement of personnel involved in the development, design or testing of aerodynamic surfaces (whether employee, consultant, contractor, secondee or any other type of permanent or temporary personnel) with another competitor, either directly or via an external entity, for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Article. In order that the FIA 
 may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each competitor must inform the FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using the template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations and must demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the disclosure of information, data or designs between the competitors involved. 
### 9.4 Power Unit Bench Testing Restrictions 
**9.4.1 Engine dyno test limitations** 
 a) Definitions: 
- _Engine Test Bench_ : An Engine test bench is either a power unit test bench and/or a power train     test bench.

- _Test Bench Occupancy Hours:_ Time interval between first work in the bench and last work in the     bench in any 24 hours calendar day. Work can be organized in shifts but only two shifts of     occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day. The first shift of occupancy will be     deemed to commence the first time the engine speed is above1000rpm on a given calendar day,     or at the start of the calendar day if the engine speed is already above 1000rpm, and will end at     a time, declared by the competitor, when the engine speed falls below 1000rpm on the same     calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the engine     speed is above 1000rpm following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar     day) and will end, either when the engine speed falls below 1000rpm for the last time on the     same calendar day or, at the end of the calendar day in the event a run is still in progress. 
- _Test Bench Operation Hours:_ Time with engine speed > 7500 RPM. 
- _Power Unit Testing:_ Restricted Power Unit Testing is any testing by a PU manufacturer, or any     Related Party of that PU manufacturer, or any agent or sub-contractor of the PU manufacturer     or any of its Related Parties, in a test environment of a complete or incomplete F1 PU, but     always including the engine, in order to measure the torque produced by this assembly or any     parameters related to the function of this assembly. 
- _Annual shutdown:_ Period when no occupancy hours nor operations hours may be incremented. 
- _Commissioning:_ Dyno activity whose only purpose is to test the bench. A test can be considered     as commissioning if the following criteria are met:        o _Must be declared to FIA with a minimum of 4 weeks’ notice_        o _Must be approved by FIA_        o _A 2 years or more old engine is used_

 This base dyno testing limitations includes the provision for any testing for a team for a calendar year (Including but not limited to gearbox, car systems, fuel and engine oil testing). Should a PU supplier provide PU’s to other teams who design their own gearbox, or exhaust, or have their own fuel or oil supplier, 30 additional operation hours will be allocated per calendar year and per additional customer team specifically and exclusively for approving these items subject to agreement with the PU supplier and the FIA technical department. Should an additional customer team requests to its PU supplier and the FIA to be able to run with a fuel and/or an engine oil different to the one(s) that is(are) already homologated for use with their engine; and should the PU supplier considers that this fuel and/or engine oil is(are) ready to be used in race events, the PU supplier may request approval of this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil. Once this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil are approved, an extra allocation of 30 operation hours may be given by FIA specifically and exclusively for endurance validation of this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil. This extra allocation can only happen a maximum of 2 times per championship season in 2021 and 2022 and 1 time per championship season from 2023 onwards. In all cases, these additional hours must be jointly declared to FIA by the PU supplier and the customer team. Additional occupancy hours to support the additional operation hours above will be granted at a ratio of 8:1 
 e) Exceptions: Commissioning activities are not counted either for occupancy or operation.

## ARTICLE 10: APPROVED CHANGES FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS 
Note: changes (in relation to the 2021 text of this document) are shown thus. Parameters still to be decided are shown thus. 
### 10.1 Changes for 2022 
**10.1.1 Changes to Article 5.10.2** 
 5.10.2 No team personnel who are associated in any way with the operation of the cars are permitted within the confines of the circuit during the following times: a. A thirteen hour period which commences seventeen hours before the scheduled start times of P1 b. A ten and a half hour period that commences thirteen and a half hours before the scheduled start of P3. With the exception of Monaco, if the unrestricted time between the end of P2 and the start of the second restricted period exceeds four hours the excess will be added to the second restricted period. Each team will be permitted two individual exceptions to the above during a Championship season, however, both of these exceptions may not be used during a single Competition.

## APPENDIX 4: SUPPLY OF POWER UNITS FOR THE 2021-2025 CHAMPIONSHIP 
## SEASONS 
**a)** No power unit may be used in a given Championship season unless the Power Unit Manufacturer supplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions. Each of the Power Unit Manufacturers of an homologated power unit must: 
i) provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units are to be supplied, with the list of teams (clearly identifying the appointed “works/factory” team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the given Championship season; 
ii) if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the season preceding that in which such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of teams (“T”) equal to the following equation: 
## T = (11^1 -A)/(B-C) 
**- A** = Total number of teams (including “works/factory” teams) having a supply agreement     concluded for the given Championship season with a New Power Unit Manufacturer. 
**- B** = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given     Championship season. 
**- C** = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship season. 
 provided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full team (e.g. 11 teams divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer must, if called upon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 teams). 
1 This figure will be reviewed each year as the “total number of entered teams” will not be known until November preceding the Championship season. The figure of 11 covers supply of 12 teams or less in compliance with the calculation rule. 
 In doing so, the FIA will first allocate the power unit supply between the Power Unit Manufacturers that are supplying the fewest number of teams, provided that the teams without a supply agreement shall be allocated to the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) that supplies(supply) the lowest number of teams and so on. If there is more than one Power Unit Manufacturer supplying the fewest number of teams (i.e. in the same position) and/or more than one team requesting a supply the allocation between such Power Unit Manufacturers shall occur by ballot (which ballot shall be transparent and undertaken by the FIA in the presence of a representative of each of the Power Unit Manufacturer(s) and the new Customer Team concerned). Any such allocation made by the FIA will have to be formalised by a supply agreement with the concerned team by 1 August at the latest (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA). A New Power Unit Manufacturer will not be required to comply with this obligation of supply as set out above. 
**b)** The FIA shall be entitled to request a Power Unit Manufacturer to supply a team ( **“New Customer Team”** ) with a power unit under the terms of this Appendix except if, at the date set out in Article a) i) above: 
**-** such team has entered into a supply agreement with a Power Unit Manufacturer for a given     Championship season before the date set out in Article a)i) above, and 
**-** such team has been granted a right, under a currently binding offer with a Power Unit     Manufacturer, to be supplied with a power unit for such given Championship season. Moreover, such Power Unit Manufacturer shall only be required to supply a New Customer Team if the following cumulative conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, then the Power Unit Manufacturer may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, decline the request to supply such New Customer Team and the decline of such request shall not be deemed to be a breach of the terms set out in this Appendix (however Article b) cannot be applied or interpreted by the Power Unit Manufacturer in a way which would deprive the obligation of supply as referred to in Article a) above of any effect and/or that would prevent the FIA from making and enforcing the provisions set out in Article a) above. The Power Unit Manufacturer undertakes to exercise in good faith the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 to 11 below). The teams and the Power Unit Manufacturers remain free to negotiate the terms of the supply agreement, subject to the fall-back positions set out below which shall apply should a team and a Power Unit Manufacturer fail to reach an agreement, despite negotiating in good faith. 
1. For the purpose of this paragraph, supply contract only refers to the contract related to the     FIA Supply Perimeter as per the Sporting and Technical Regulations and as set out in     Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations (Column “Supply Perim”). **1.1** Any supply contract entered into with the New Customer Team must be on substantially the same terms as those entered into between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the other customer teams (other than its appointed “works/factory” team) to whom it already supplies a power unit at the date of the FIA request (“ **Existing Customer Team** ”), other than the Price as referred to in paragraph 8 below. In particular, the Power Unit Manufacturer may impose and the team cannot refuse to sign up to any terms which at least one of its other Existing Customer Teams has agreed to and the Power Unit Manufacturer may refuse and the team cannot request the inclusion of terms which are not included in the supply agreements with other Existing Customer Teams. 
**1.2** In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall have the right to decide, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the payment terms and conditions (including the price of additional goods and services not included in the supply perimeters designated in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations (Column “Supply Perim.”), but excluding the Price which shall be determined in compliance with the definition of Price below) applicable to the New Customer Team subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 below. **1.3** In case of a dispute about the application or the interpretation of paragraph 1 hereto, the FIA will be entitled to request copies of the contracts being entered into by the Power Unit Manufacturer with any customer team, provided that such contracts are not disclosed to any new Customer Team and subject to the FIA agreeing to comply with strict customary confidentiality obligations. 
2. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the     duration of the term of the power unit supply which: 
**2.1** may not be lower than one Championship season; and 
**2.2** shall not exceed three Championship seasons, unless jointly agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team 
3. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, whether     the New Customer Team shall use the name of the Power Unit Manufacturer or the New     Customer Team shall operate under a white label/unbranded way and, for this purpose, use     a different name: 
**3.1** The use of this different name shall always be agreed in advance by the Power Unit Manufacturer, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; and 
**3.2** In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is required without being requested by the New Customer Team, this supply will not incur additional fees for the New Customer Team except if the use of the power unit name leads to the conclusion of a commercial agreement between the New Customer Team and any third party. In that case, the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall commonly agree on the fair and reasonable part of the revenues generated by the commercial agreement which could be considered as additional fees; 
**3.3** In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is requested by the New Customer Team and agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer, this supply may incur additional fees for the New Customer Team, such fees being determined at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Power Unit Manufacturer in a fair and reasonable manner. 
4. The New Customer Team shall provide a warranty that it has no binding contracts or     option(s) in place with another power unit manufacturer for future supply of power units.     The New Customer Team shall be required to terminate any such contracts or option(s)     which do exist in so far as they conflict with any part of the period of the contract being     entered into with the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
5. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) be an     Automotive Manufacturer or any of its affiliated companies which has been set up with the     purpose amongst other things of participating in the Championship. 
6. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) have any     sponsorship agreement in place with any entity, which is in competition with the Core     Activities of an Automotive Manufacturer which are carried out by the Power Unit     Manufacturer. 
7. The New Customer Team and/or any senior executives, directors or beneficial shareholders     of the New Customer Team should not at any time (i) be listed or included in the official EU     and/or US published sanction lists; (ii) have been convicted of any indictable criminal     offence; (iii) have been convicted by any government or government agency in connection     with fraud, money laundering, racketeering or terrorism activities; and/or (iv) have been     declared bankrupt; and/or (v) have committed other identified action which, in the     reasonable opinion of the Power Unit Manufacturer, harms the reputation of such Power     Unit Manufacturer. This clause shall also reciprocally apply to the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
8. The Power Unit Supply Perimeter listed in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations (Column     “Supply Perim.”) shall be supplied to New Customer Teams at the Price. 
The supply of additional goods or services not listed in Appendix 3 of the Technical Regulations (Column “Supply Perim.”) (which shall be agreed between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) shall incur additional charges, the amount of which shall be substantially the same as that applied by the Power Unit Manufacturer to its Existing Customer Team. In the event that a Power Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other Existing Customer Team, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall decide the price of the above-mentioned additional goods and services based on the usages and practices generally recognised and respected in the market for the supply of parts and services in the Championship. 
9. The FIA shall confirm in writing to the Power Unit Manufacturer that, to the best of its     knowledge, the New Customer Team, including its officers, directors and beneficial     shareholders, has not been convicted of non-complying at all times with the FIA Code of     Good Standing. 
10. Payment of the fees (directly or indirectly through a payment guarantee) under the supply     contract for each season shall as a fall-back position (unless otherwise agreed between the     Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) and, notwithstanding the terms of     any contract with an Existing Customer Team or its own factory team, be made in four     instalments: 
**-** 25% on the date of signature of the supply contract; 
**-** 25% on or before 30 October of the calendar year prior to the year of supply; 
**-** 30% before the start of the Championship season; and 
**-** The remaining 20% before the fifth Formula One Competition of the Championship season. 
**10.1** In case of any delayed payment for an amount greater than €100,000, the Power Unit Manufacturer shall send the New Customer Team a written notice of the breach, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the New Customer Team fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the Power Unit Manufacturer (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the Power Unit Manufacturer shall be entitled to either terminate the supply contract immediately by serving written notice on the New Customer Team, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder, or, suspend delivery of the power units to the New Customer Team. 
**10.2** In case of breach of the obligation to deliver the power units and/or to supply additional goods or services to the New Customer Team pursuant to the supply agreement, such New Customer Team may send the Power Unit Manufacturer a written notice of the breach (but only in the event that the New Customer Team is not itself in breach of contract including for non-payment except if that non-payment is justified by an alleged breach of the supply contract by the Power Unit Manufacturer), with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the Power Unit Manufacturer fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the New Customer Team (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the New Customer Team shall be entitled to suspend payment of the fees to the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
11. The New Customer Team and the Power Unit Manufacturer shall not, and will procure its     affiliates and/or their respective senior executives, employees, directors and shareholders     shall not take any action and/or make any omission, deceptive, misleading or disparaging or     negative comments, which directly injures, damages or brings into disrepute the public     reputation, goodwill or favourable name or image of the other party to the supply     agreement. 
**d)** Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3.4.4 of the F1 Sporting Regulations, unless agreed otherwise by the FIA, each of the manufacturers of an homologated power unit may not directly or indirectly supply power units for more than (T+1) teams, with T as defined in Article a). Such consent shall not be given if one or more of the other Power Unit Manufacturers are supplying less that T teams. 
**e)** Ceasing the supply of the power units. 
Any manufacturer of a homologated power unit wishing to cease the supply of power units must notify the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January of the year preceding that in which such power units will no longer be supplied. 
**f)** In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with any of the obligations of the present Appendix, the FIA shall engage good faith and active discussions with the Power Unit Manufacturer and, in the absence of amicable solution within one month, be entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the Power Unit Manufacturer. In the case that, in accordance of the provisions of the Code and of the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, the International Tribunal rules that the Power Unit Manufacturer has materially breached or materially failed to comply with Articles a) and/or c), the International Tribunal may impose on the Power Unit Manufacturer concerned, to the exclusion of any other sanction it may have the power to impose, a fine (the amount of which shall be no more than fifteen million euros and shall be determined, on a case by case basis, depending on the merits and circumstances of the applicable case). 
#### DEFINITIONS
