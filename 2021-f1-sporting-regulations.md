It consists of the Formula One Grand Prix races which are included in the Formula One calendar and in respect of which the ASNs and organisers have signed organisation agreements with the FIA. All the participating parties (FIA, ASNs, organisers, Competitors and circuits) undertake to apply as well as observe the rules governing the Championship and must hold FIA Super Licences which are issued to drivers, Competitors, officials, organisers and circuits. 
## 1) REGULATIONS 
**1.1** The final text of these Sporting Regulations shall be the English version which will be used should any dispute arise as to their interpretation. Headings in this document are for ease of reference only and do not form part of these Sporting Regulations. **1.2** These Sporting Regulations apply to the whole calendar year referred to in the title, and to the Championship taking place within that calendar year (“the Championship”). Any changes made by the FIA for safety reasons may come into effect without notice or delay. **2) GENERAL UNDERTAKING 2.1** All drivers, Competitors and officials participating in the Championship undertake, on behalf of themselves, their employees, agents and suppliers, to observe all the provisions as supplemented or amended of the International Sporting Code (the Code), the Formula One Technical Regulations (Technical Regulations), the Formula One Financial Regulations (Financial Regulations) and the present Sporting Regulations together referred to as “the Regulations”. **2.2** The Championship and each of its Events is governed by the FIA in accordance with the Regulations. Event means any event entered into the FIA Formula One Championship Calendar for any year commencing 24 hours before P1 is scheduled to take place and ending at the time for the lodging of a protest under the terms of the Code or the time when a technical or sporting certification has been carried out under the terms of the Code, whichever is the later. **2.3** Any special national regulations must be submitted to the FIA with the original application for inclusion of an Event on the international calendar. Only with the approval of the FIA can such special regulations come into force for an Event. **3) GENERAL CONDITIONS 3.1** It is the Competitor's responsibility to ensure that all persons concerned by his entry observe all the requirements of the Regulations. If a Competitor is unable to be present in person at the Event, he must nominate his representative in writing. The person having charge of an entered car during any part of an Event is responsible jointly and severally with the Competitor for ensuring that the requirements are observed. **3.2** Competitors must ensure that their cars comply with the conditions of eligibility and safety throughout each practice session and the race. **3.3** The presentation of a car for initial scrutineering (see Article 25.1 below) will be deemed an implicit statement of conformity. **3.4** All persons concerned in any way with an entered car or present in any other capacity whatsoever in the paddock, pit lane, or track must wear an appropriate pass at all times. **3.5** No pass may be issued or used other than with the agreement of the FIA. A pass may be used only by the person and for the purpose for which it was issued. **3.6** Each Competitor must hold the minimum FIA Environmental Accreditation as follows: a) 2 Star Rating by 30 June 2022 b) 3 Star Rating by 30 June 2023 
## 4) LICENCES 
**4.1** All drivers, Competitors and officials participating in the Championship must hold a FIA Super Licence. Applications for Super Licences must be made annually to the FIA through the applicant's ASN. **4.2** With the exception of a reprimand or fine, when a penalty is applied under the Code or Article 38.3 the stewards may impose penalty points on a driver’s Super Licence. If a driver accrues 12 penalty points his licence will be suspended for the following Event, following which 12 points will be removed from the licence. Penalty points will remain on a driver’s Super Licence for a period of 12 months after which they will be respectively removed on the 12 month anniversary of their imposition. **5) CHAMPIONSHIP EVENTS 5.1** Events are reserved for Formula One cars as defined in the Technical Regulations. 
**5. 2** Each Event will have the status of an international restricted competition. **5.3** The distance of all races, from the start signal referred to in Article 36. 10 to the end-of-race     signal referred to in Article 43.1, shall be equal to the least number of complete laps which     exceed a distance of 305km. However, should two hours elapse before the scheduled race     distance is completed, the leader will be shown the end-of-race signal when he crosses the     control line (the Line) at the end of the lap following the lap during which the two (2) hour period     ended, provided this does not result in the scheduled number of laps being exceeded. Only     under the circumstances below will any exception be made to the above: a) The distance of the race in Monaco shall be equal to the least number of complete laps     which exceed a distance of 260km. b) Should the race be suspended (see Article 41) the length of the suspension will be added     to this period up to a maximum total race time of three (3) hours. c) If the formation lap is started behind the safety car (see Article 36. 15 c)) the number of     race laps will be reduced by the number of laps carried out by the safety car minus one. 
**5. 4** The maximum number of Events in the Championship is 23 , the minimum is 8. **5.5** The final list of Events is published by the FIA before 1 January each year. 
**5. 6** An Event which is cancelled with less than three months’ written notice to the FIA will not be     considered for inclusion in the following year's Championship unless the FIA judges the     cancellation to have been due to force majeure. 
**5. 7** An Event may be cancelled if fewer than twelve ( 12 ) cars are available for it. **6) WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP 6.1** The Formula One World Championship driver's title will be awarded to the driver who has scored     the highest number of points, taking into consideration all the results obtained during the Events     which have actually taken place. **6.2** The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor will be awarded to the Competitor which     has scored the highest number of points, results from both cars (see Article 8.6) being taken into     account. 
## 7) DEAD HEAT

No Competitor may sell or make available any such car to any third party without the prior authorisation of the FIA. TPC may only be carried out with cars built to the specification of the period and only tyres manufactured specifically for this purpose may be used. Each Competitor will also be permitted to carry out Demonstration Events (DE) with the above cars which will not be considered TPC. A DE shall be defined as an event in which a Competitor participates purely for demonstration purposes. 
- Be in possession of an International A Licence; and 
- Not have competed in more than two Formula 1 World Championship races     during their career. c) A maximum of 30 car-days of testing for the sole purpose of providing the appointed tyre supplier with the chance to test improvements to the design of their tyres, carried out between 1 February 2021 and one week following the end of the last Event of the Championship, organised by the FIA in consultation with all Competitors and the appointed tyre supplier. Only cars that raced in the 2018, 2019 or 2020 Championships, appropriately modified, may be used for any such tests that get carried out before the first Event of the 2021 Championship. Furthermore, with the exception of tyres, wheel rims and wheel rim covers, no car or subcomponent that is intended to provide technical information for the 2022 Technical Regulations will be permitted. Any such testing scheduled at a circuit hosting an Event of the Championship may only be carried out after that Event has taken place. d) One day, carried out between the start of a ten (10) day period which precedes the start of the second Event and the last Event of the Championship, in case a Competitor declares that one of its current race drivers is to be substituted by a driver who has not participated in a Formula 1 World Championship race in the two previous calendar years. The following must be observed: i) Any such day may only be carried out by the new driver and may not take place on a circuit hosting a race in the current Championship year. ii) Any such day may only take place within a period 14 days prior to the substitution and 14 days after the substitution has taken place.

Upon deciding to grant     an application to hold an Event, the FIA will invite the relevant ASN to organise it or to nominate     an organiser. If the ASN is not in a position to do so, the FIA may itself appoint an organiser. The     organiser must be a club or body acceptable to the FIA and must enter into an organisation     agreement with the FIA when it applies to organise the Event. **13 ) INSURANCE 13 .1** The promoter of an Event must procure that all Competitors, their personnel and drivers are     covered by third party insurance in accordance with the FIA requirements. 
## 18 ) SANCTIONS 
**18 .1** The stewards may impose the penalties specifically set out in these Sporting Regulations in addition to or instead of any other penalties available to them under the Code. **18 .2** Any driver who receives three (3) reprimands in the same Championship will, upon the imposition of the third, be given a ten (10) grid place penalty at that Event. If the third reprimand is imposed following an Incident during a race the ten (10) grid place penalty will be applied at the driver’s next Event. The ten (10) grid place penalty will only be imposed if at least two (2) of the reprimands were imposed for a driving infringement. **19) PRESS CONFERENCES, MEDIA OPPORTUNITIES, DRIVERS PARADE AND NATIONAL ANTHEM 19.1** Day before first practice: a) The Media Delegate will arrange a press conference for a period of up to three and a half (3.5) hours commencing twenty-three (23) hours before the scheduled start of P1. All drivers are required to attend this press conference. Each driver will be assigned a slot of up to forty-five (45) minutes within this period at each Event, which will be communicated to each Competitor a minimum of 14 days prior to each Event.

## 24 ) SUPPLY OF TYRES IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND TYRE LIMITATION DURING THE EVENT 
**24.1** Supply of tyres: The single tyre manufacturer (the Supplier) appointed by the FIA must undertake to provide: a) Three specifications of dry-weather tyre at each Event, each of which must be visibly distinguishable from one another when a car is on the track. b) At certain Events one additional specification of dry-weather tyre may be made available to all Competitors for evaluation purposes following a recommendation to the FIA from the Supplier. Competitors will be informed about such an additional specification at least one week before the start of the relevant Event. c) One specification of intermediate tyre at each Event. d) One specification of wet-weather tyre at each Event. **24.2** Quantity, selection and specification of tyres during an Event: a) Except under Articles 24.1(b), 24.4(e) and 24.4(f), no driver may use more than thirteen (13) sets of dry-weather tyres, four (4) sets of intermediate tyres and three (3) sets of wetweather tyres during an Event. A complete set of tyres will be deemed to comprise two (2) front and two (2) rear tyres all of which must be of the same specification and as allocated by the FIA, however, sets of the same specification may be mixed following the qualifying practice session. b) Unless otherwise determined by the FIA and with the agreement of the Supplier, no less than two (2) weeks prior to each Event, the FIA will provide all Competitors with the following information relevant to the Event in question: i) Which tyre specifications will be made available by the Supplier. ii) The mandatory dry-weather race tyre specification(s) (up to two (2)). iii) The mandatory dry-weather Q3 tyre specification (which will always be the softest of the three (3) specifications). Unless otherwise determined by the FIA and with the agreement of the Supplier, each Driver will be allocated the following specification of dry-weather tyres at each Event: i) Two (2) sets of the hard specification of tyres. ii) Three (3) sets of the medium specification of tyres. iii) Eight (8) sets of the soft specification of tyres. c) Once the above selections have been made the Technical Delegate will allocate sets of tyres to each driver from among the stock of tyres the Supplier makes available for the Event. **24.3** Control of tyres: a) The outer sidewall of all tyres which are to be used at an Event must be marked with a unique identification. b) Other than in cases of force majeure (accepted as such by the stewards), all tyres intended for use at an Event must be presented to the Technical Delegate for allocation prior to the start of the Event. c) At any time during an Event, and at his absolute discretion, the Technical Delegate may select alternative dry-weather tyres to be used by any Competitor or driver from among the stock of tyres the Supplier has present at the Event. 
36. 15 c)), or the race resumed in accordance with Article 42. 6 a), the use of wet-weather tyres until the safety car returns to the pits is compulsory. A penalty under Article 38.3d) will be imposed on any driver who does not use wet weather tyres whilst the safety car is on the track at such times. **24 .5** Testing of tyres: a) From the time at which each Competitor receives fitted tyres from the Supplier at or before an Event these may not be used on any rig, simulator or vehicle, other than the F1 car for which they were intended. 
**31. 1** No driver may start in the race without taking part in at least one (1) practice session. 
**31. 2** During all practices there will be a green and a red light at the end of the pit lane. Cars may only     leave the pit lane when the green light is on. Additionally, a blue flag and/or a flashing blue light     will be shown in the pit exit to warn drivers leaving the pit lane if cars are approaching on the     track. 
**31. 3** Unless written permission has been given by the FIA to do otherwise, the circuit may only be     used for purposes other than the Event after the last practice session on each day of practice     and on the day of the race no less than one hour before the end of the pit lane is opened to     allow cars to cover a reconnaissance lap. 
**31. 4** In the event of a driving infringement during any practice session the Stewards may delete a     driver’s lap time (or lap times) or drop the driver such number of grid positions as they consider     appropriate. Unless it is completely clear that a driver committed a driving infringement any     such incident will normally be investigated after the relevant session. Where appropriate, regard will also be given to the provisions of Article 18.1. 
**31. 5** Any driver taking part in any practice session who, in the opinion of the stewards, stops     unnecessarily on the circuit or unnecessarily impedes another driver shall be subject to the     penalties referred to in Article 31.4. 
**31. 6** Should it become necessary to stop any practice session because the circuit is blocked by an     accident or because weather or other conditions make it dangerous to continue, the clerk of the     course will order red flags to be shown at all marshal posts and the abort lights to be shown at     the Line. When the signal is given to stop all cars must immediately reduce speed and proceed slowly     back to the pit lane. In order to ensure that drivers reduce speed sufficiently, from the time at     which the “RED FLAG” message appears on the official messaging system until the time that     each car crosses the first safety car line when entering the pit lane, drivers must stay above the     minimum time set by the FIA ECU at least once in each marshalling sector (a marshalling sector     is defined as the section of track between each of the FIA light panels). All cars abandoned on the track will be removed to a safe place.     At the end of each practice session no driver may cross the Line more than once. 
**31. 7** The clerk of the course may interrupt practice as often and for as long as he thinks necessary to     clear the track or to allow the recovery of a car. However, only during qualifying practice will the     session be extended as a result. Should one or more sessions be thus interrupted, no protest can be accepted as to the possible     effects of the interruption on the qualification of drivers admitted to start. **32) FREE PRACTICE** 
**32. 1** a) Two (2) free practice sessions (P1 and P2), each lasting one (1) hour and separated by at     least two and a half (2.5) hours, will take place on the second day of the Event. b) A further free practice session (P3), lasting one (1) hour and starting no less than nineteen     (19) hours after the end of P2, will take place the day before the race. **33) QUALIFYING PRACTICE 33.1** The qualifying practice session will take place on the day before the race and will start no less     than two (2) hours after the end of P3. The qualifying practice session will be run as follows: a) For the first eighteen (18) minutes of the session (Q1) all cars will be permitted on the     track and at the end of this period the slowest five (5) cars will be prohibited from taking     any further part in the session. Lap times achieved by the fifteen (15) remaining cars will then be deleted. b) After a seven (7) minute break the session will resume for fifteen (15) minutes (Q2) and     the fifteen (15) remaining cars will be permitted on the track. At the end of this period     the slowest five (5) cars will be prohibited from taking any further part in the session. Lap times achieved by the ten (10) remaining cars will then be deleted. c) After an eight (8) minute break the session will resume for twelve (12) minutes (Q3) and     the ten (10) remaining cars will be permitted on the track. The above procedure is based upon twenty ( 20 ) cars being officially eligible to take part in the     Event. If twenty-two ( 22 ) cars are eligible, six (6) will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2, if twenty- 
**36. 10** When the cars come back to the grid at the end of the formation lap (or laps, see Articles 36. 15 c)     and 42. 10 ), they must stop within their respective starting grid positions, keeping their engines     running. There will be a standing start, the signal being given by means of lights activated by the     permanent starter. Once all the cars have come to a halt the five second light will appear followed by the four, three,     two and one second lights. At any time after the one-second light appears, the race will be     started by extinguishing all red lights. 
**36. 11** Unless specifically authorised by the Safety Delegate, during the start of a race the pit wall must     be kept free of all persons with the exception of the team personnel permitted under Article     22.13, officials and fire marshals. **36. 12** If, after returning to the starting grid at the end of the formation lap a problem arises, the     following procedures shall apply: a) If a car develops a problem that could endanger the start the driver must immediately     raise his hands above his head and the marshal responsible for that row must immediately     wave a yellow flag. If the Race Director decides the start should be aborted the green     lights will be illuminated two seconds after the abort lights are switched on, a board saying     “EXTRA FORMATION LAP” will be displayed and all Competitors will be informed using the     official messaging system. All cars able to do so must complete a further formation lap     whilst the car which developed the problem is moved into the pit lane. When leaving the grid to complete the extra formation lap all drivers must respect the pit     lane speed limit until they pass pole position. The Competitor may then attempt to rectify the problem and, if successful, the car may     then start from the end of the pit lane. Should there be more than one car involved their     starting order will be determined by the order in which they reached the end of the pit     lane. Every time this happens the race will be shortened by one (1) lap. 
**36. 14** Any of the penalties under Articles 38.3 a), b), or c) will be imposed on any driver who is judged     to have: a) Moved before the start signal is given, such judgement being made by an FIA approved     and supplied transponder fitted to each car, or; b) Positioned his car on the starting grid in such a way that the transponder is unable to     detect the moment at which the car first moved from its grid position after the start signal     is given. **36. 15** Only in the following cases will any variation in the start procedure be allowed: a) If it starts to rain after the seven (7) minute signal but before the race is started and, in     the opinion of the Race Director Competitors should be given the opportunity to change     tyres, the abort lights will be shown at the start line and the starting procedure will begin     again at the ten (10) minute point. b) If the start of the race is imminent and, in the opinion of the Race Director, the volume of     water on the track is such that it cannot be negotiated safely even on wet-weather tyres,     the abort lights will be shown on the Line and all Competitors will be informed of the likely     delay via the official messaging system. Once the start time is known at least ten (10)     minutes warning will be given. c) If track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the race at the scheduled time the     start of the formation lap may take place behind the safety car. If this is the case, at the     ten (10) minute signal its orange lights will be illuminated, this being the signal to the 
**42. 9** Either of the penalties under Article 38.3c) or d) will be imposed on any driver who, in the     opinion of the stewards, unnecessarily overtook another car during the lap (or laps). 
**42. 10** The safety car will enter the pits after one lap unless: a) The race is being resumed in wet conditions and the Race Director deems more than one     lap necessary, in which case see Article 24.4(l). b) All cars are not yet in a line behind the safety car. c) A further incident occurs necessitating another intervention. 
**42. 11** When the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car a message “STANDING     START” will be sent to all Competitors via the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will     display “SS” and the car's orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the     Competitors and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall     more than ten car lengths behind it. Once the safety car has entered the pit lane all cars, with the exception of those that were in     their garage at the time the race was suspended (see Article 41.3), must return to the grid, take     up their grid positions and follow the procedures set out in Articles 36.9 to 36. 14. 
**42. 12** If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to start     the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all Competitors via     the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car's orange lights will     be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it will be entering the     pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall     more than ten car lengths behind it. As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and     replaced by waved green flags with green lights at the Line. No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the     first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. 
**42. 13** If, after several laps behind the safety car, track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume     racing at all, the message “RE-START PROCEDURE SUSPENDED” will be sent to all Competitors     via the official messaging system and all cars must enter the pit lane behind the safety car. The     procedures set out in Article 41 and Articles 42.1-42. 9 must then be followed and there will be     no standing start. 
**42. 14** If the race cannot be resumed the results will be taken at the end of the penultimate lap before     the lap during which the signal to suspend the race was given. **43 ) FINISH 43.1** A chequered flag will be the end-of-race signal and will be shown at the Line as soon as the     leading car has covered the full race distance in accordance with Article 5.3. **43 .2** Should for any reason the end-of-race signal be given before the leading car completes the     scheduled number of laps, or the prescribed time has been completed, the race will be deemed     to have finished when the leading car last crossed the Line before the signal was given. Should the end-of- race signal be delayed for any reason, the race will be deemed to have     finished when it should have finished. **43 .3** After receiving the end-of-race signal all cars must proceed on the circuit directly to the post-     race parc fermé without any unnecessary delay, without receiving any object whatsoever and     without any assistance (except that of the marshals if necessary). An exception to Article 2 2. 4 and to the above will be made for the winning driver who may     perform an act of celebration before reaching parc fermé, provided any such act: a) Is performed safely and does not endanger other drivers or any officials. b) Does not call into question the legality of his car. c) Does not delay the podium ceremony. Any classified car which cannot reach the post-race parc fermé under its own power will be     placed under the exclusive control of the marshals who will take the car to the parc fermé. **44 ) POST RACE PARC FERMÉ 44 .1** Only those officials charged with supervision may enter the post-race parc fermé. No     intervention of any kind is allowed there unless authorised by such officials. **44. 2** When the parc fermé is in use, parc fermé regulations will apply in the area between the Line     and the parc fermé entrance. **44 .3** The parc fermé shall be secured such that no unauthorised persons can gain access to it. **45 ) CLASSIFICATION 45 .1** The car placed first will be the one having covered the scheduled distance in the shortest time,     or, where appropriate, passed the Line in the lead at the end of two hours (or more under Article     5.3). All cars will be classified taking into account the number of complete laps they have     covered, and for those which have completed the same number of laps, the order in which they     crossed the Line. **45 .2** Cars having covered less than 90% of the number of laps covered by the winner (rounded down     to the nearest whole number of laps), will not be classified.

## APPENDIX 3 
## PODIUM CEREMONY 
At each Closed Event as defined in Article 21.6 of the Sporting Regulations, the procedure for the Podium Ceremony will be detailed in Event Notes issued by the Race Director. At each Open Event as defined in Article 21.6 of the Sporting Regulations, the procedure for the Podium Ceremony is detailed below. 
**1. MASTER OF CEREMONIES** A master of ceremonies will be appointed by the FIA to conduct and take responsibility for the     entire podium ceremony. 
**2. PODIUM** a) ROSTRUM AND DAIS The dimensions of the dais must follow those found in the FIA graphic design manual. The distance between the edge of the winner's dais and the retaining barrier of the     podium should be a minimum of 120cm to provide a walkway. The place where each person presenting a trophy should stand must be marked on the     floor of the podium. Trophies must be laid out on a single table on one side of the podium. The champagne     must be on the dais. b) FLAGS Olympic Games style "flat flags" should be used. There must be a minimum space of 50cm     behind the podium structure for the flag men. c) FLOOR The podium and steps should be covered in green or dark blue carpet. 
**3. ANTHEMS** a) The national anthem of the winning driver and winning constructor will be played. The     Nationalities of the constructors and drivers will be notified to the organiser by the FIA     and will accord with Article 9.5.2 of the Code. b) A suitable sound system should be installed to ensure that national anthems, (initiated     by the master of ceremonies) are clearly heard with an audio link to the TV broadcast. c) When the champagne shower begins, music should be played. This should not start until     the presenters have left the podium. d) A commentary of the podium ceremony should be broadcast to the general public from     the platform erected for the TV cameras. 
**4. TROPHIES** Only 4 trophies will be presented during the podium ceremony: a) Winning driver. b) A representative of the winning constructor. c) Second driver. d) Third driver. The trophies, which must be in the form of traditional cups, will be provided by the ASN and     must show: e) The FIA Formula 1 World Championship official logo. 
**5. SCENARIO** a) Only three persons should be on the podium to present the trophies. In exceptional     circumstances, the master of ceremonies may increase this to four. b) No police, bodyguards or persons not authorised by the master of ceremonies are     allowed on the podium. c) The master of ceremonies will inform the TV and public address commentator of the     names of the persons presenting the trophies. d) The master of ceremonies must be on the side of the podium where the trophies are     located. The persons presenting the trophies will be on the other side. The master of     ceremonies will hand the trophies to those presenting them. 
**6. TELEVISION** The ideal position for the TV camera is immediately opposite the podium and at the same     height. Under no circumstances must there be a TV camera man on the podium. 
**7. PARC FERMÉ** The parc fermé must be positioned as close as possible to the podium, preferably immediately     below, with direct access. As soon as all the cars have crossed the Line, a course car must go round the track to collect any     driver who has finished in the first three but is stranded on the circuit. The drivers must not be delayed in the parc fermé. One person, nominated by the master of     ceremonies and in radio contact with him, will be responsible for moving the drivers from the     parc fermé to the podium without delay. Only persons authorised by the master of ceremonies     may make contact with the drivers before the end of the TV unilateral interviews. 
**8. UNILATERAL ROOM** The unilateral room must be adjacent to the podium. The master of ceremonies will see that     the drivers proceed there immediately after the podium ceremony. The room should be suitably     ventilated (or air conditioned if the temperature is above 25°C). 
**9. PRESS ROOM** Immediately after the TV interviews, drivers must go to the press room for interviews. 
**10. WATER + TOWELS** 3 bottles of water must be put in the parc fermé (no identification). 3 bottles of water must be put in the unilateral room (no identification). 3 towels must be available in the unilateral room. No other drinks are permitted in the parc fermé or unilateral room. 
**11. PODIUM PROTOCOL (except for Monaco)** The winning driver's award will be presented by the head of state or the prime minister of the     host country or the FIA President. If such a person is not available, a comparable person within     the host country, or a dignitary of international status should be invited. Should neither of these     be available, the President of the ASN will be invited to present the winner's trophy. The constructor's award must be presented by the official representative of the naming rights sponsor of the Event. In the absence of a naming rights sponsor, the master of ceremonies will select a suitable person. The second and third drivers' awards must be presented by the President of the ASN, unless local circumstances require an additional dignitary to be present. In this case, the latter will present the second award and the ASN president the third. Should the ASN president be unavailable or presenting the winning driver's trophy, the master of ceremonies will select a suitable replacement. An invitation will be issued to each person attending the podium ceremony, with clear instructions as to the procedure to follow. 
## APPENDIX 4 
## 2020 2025 POWER UNIT HOMOLOGATION 
1) Any Power Unit Manufacturer intending to homologate a power unit for use by a Competitor(s) in the 2020 to 2025 Championships must submit to the FIA a power unit homologation dossier on or before 28 February of the year in which it intends to supply such power unit for use during the Championship period indicated. Each Power Unit Manufacturer shall be permitted to present only one homologation dossier with respect to the period and the homologation granted will be valid until the end of the 2025 Championship. 2) The homologation dossier must include: a) Details of all the parts described as “INC” in the “App. 4 PU homol.” column of Appendix 2 of Technical Regulations. b) All documents required in Article a) of Appendix 9 of these Sporting Regulations. 3) The power unit supply perimeter listed in Appendix 9A of these Regulations shall be supplied at the maximum price of fifteen million euros. The supply of additional goods or services not listed in Appendix 9A (which shall be agreed between the manufacturer and the Competitor) shall incur additional charges, the amount of which shall be based on the usages and practices generally recognised and respected in the market for the supply of parts and services in the Championship. In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with the provisions of this Article 3), the FIA shall be entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the manufacturer. In the case that, in accordance of the provisions of the Code and of the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, the International Tribunal rules that the manufacturer has materially breached or materially failed to comply with this Paragraph 3), the International Tribunal may impose on the manufacturer concerned, [to the exclusion of any other sanction it may have the power to impose, a fine (the amount of which shall be no more than fifteen million euros] and shall be determined, on a case by case basis, depending on the merits and circumstances of the applicable case). During its first two Championships (or part thereof), whether consecutive or not, within the [2014‐2025] period, a manufacturer will not be required to comply with the maximum price as set out above. 4) A power unit will be homologated for the relevant Competitor once a complete homologation dossier has been submitted by the relevant manufacturer and has been approved by the FIA, such approval to take place within 14 days from the submission of the homologation dossier. 5) With reference to Article 23.3 of the Sporting Regulations, each manufacturer may supply only the maximum number of specifications of PU elements as set in the second table of Appendix 2 of Technical Regulations during 2020 to 2025 Championships, except for any changes permitted by the FIA in accordance with the procedure set out in 6) below. Any changes to the homologation dossier during the homologation period must be approved by the FIA before the first use of a new or modified homologated PU at an Event. Applications must be made to the FIA with all necessary supporting information. Wherever practical, the revised homologation dossier must be submitted at least 14 days before the requested date of homologation. No changes to any of the elements listed above may have a significant impact on power unit installation in the car. Changes to any of the elements listed above that may have an impact on power unit installation in the car must be submitted to the FIA and approved by the FIA before the modifications are carried out.

## APPENDIX 8 
## AERODYNAMIC TESTING RESTRICTIONS (ATR) 
The ATR, and the definitions and rules which will apply to aerodynamic testing, are as follows: 
**1. General conditions**     a. Restricted Aerodynamic testing is the testing by a Competitor or any Associate of a        Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a        Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own        purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor in a test        environment or numerical simulation of a representation of an F1 car or sub-        component in order to measure, observe or infer any forces, displacements, pressures        or air flow direction resulting directly or indirectly from the incident air flow.     b. A three-dimensional representation of an F1 car or sub-component subject to        Restricted Aerodynamic testing, defined either physically or digitally, will be        considered for the purposes of this Article as a Restricted Aerodynamic Test Geometry        (RATG) and save for where specifically permitted by this Article may not be added to,        removed from, morphed or modified. In order to prevent Restricted Aerodynamic        testing methodologies intended to subvert any limits on the number or nature of        RATGs permitted under the ATR the following will apply:           i. The purpose of a RATG is to allow aerodynamic assessment of a single new              geometry, with aerodynamic dependency maintained throughout the simulated              flow field. Any attempt to derive aerodynamically independent results for              subcomponents of a RATG, either in the initial simulation or test, or by              subsequent modification to the simulation or test conditions, is not permitted.              Any attempt to use boundary conditions or similar to infer the effect of              combining RATGs, without accruing a further RATG, is also not permitted. The              use of boundary conditions cannot be exploited to simulate the effect on the              fluid of a geometry which is different from the RATG in use. ii. If the representation contains external bodywork surfaces or surfaces belonging to brake system air ducts on both sides of the centre plane of the car these must be symmetrical about this plane. Local exceptions for parts directly associated with the cooling of the power unit, or changes of car attitude allowed under section 3d (roll and steer) will be permitted. iii. Excluding permitted degrees of freedom for RWTT and changes in RCFDs, the substitution or replacement of any part of a RATG with a non-F1 car geometry, or the placement of any physical or computational boundary condition or solver setting, that simulates or attempts to simulate a modification to this RATG will be considered as a new RATG. iv. Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG which is used for RCFDs may be created by removing geometry from the parent RATG and placing boundary conditions of velocity or pressure profiles generated entirely from the same RATG to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been removed. This will not be considered as a new RATG provided any geometry within the section is identical to the parent RATG. Exceptionally where downstream portions of the RATG are removed these may be replaced with a single geometry approved for this purpose by the FIA. v. Sections (or sub-models) of a RATG used for RCFDs and created by removing geometry from a parent RATG may not be subsequently geometrically modified without being considered as a new RATG. Any boundary conditions of velocity or pressure profiles added in the process of creating the section (or sub-model) and used to replicate the flow field resulting from the geometry that has been 
**2. Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT)**     RWTT may only be carried out in wind tunnels which have been nominated by the Competitor     to the FIA. Each Competitor may nominate only one wind tunnel for use in any one twelve     month period and declare it in writing to the FIA. For a new entrant, the nomination must be     made no later than 7 days after the date on which it officially becomes a Competitor. No re-     nominations may be made for at least 12 months. Nominations should include the facility     location, unique identification of the wind tunnel and the scale of model and RATG to be used.     The FIA will consider, at its absolute discretion, earlier or temporary nominations if a wind     tunnel already nominated by a Competitor suffers a long term failure or for the purpose of     evaluating alternative wind tunnels. If a different facility is to be used or if the existing facility     is changed or upgraded, other than for routine maintenance or replacement, then a new     declaration must be submitted to the FIA within one month of the change or at the time of     submission of a testing period report whichever is earlier. For the avoidance of doubt, any RWTT carried out on behalf of or for the benefit of the Competitor by an Associate, a contracted party of the Competitor or of any Associate of the Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of the Competitor or for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor must take place in the wind tunnel nominated by the Competitor. 
**3. RWTT Permitted technology**     The following restrictions apply during RWTT:     a. Only wind tunnels that use air at atmospheric pressure as the test fluid are permitted.        Other than rotations of the RATG and model or ground plane about the yaw axis, designs        which attempt to create curved flow conditions relative to the RATG are not permitted. For        closed section wind tunnels adaption of vertical walls and the ceiling to improve air flow        uniformity is permitted.     b. No RWTT may be carried out using a scale model and RATG which is greater than 60% of        full size neither may it be carried out at a wind tunnel air speed exceeding 50m/s measured        relative to the scale model and RATG. Furthermore, during restricted wind tunnel testing        the magnitude of the rate of change of the wind tunnel air speed measured relative to the        scale model and RATG must be less than 4.5m/s². The rate of change of the wind tunnel air        speed will be defined as the derivative of wind tunnel air speed and smoothed using a        moving average filter, centred on each sample, of period 0.5 seconds during each wind        tunnel air speed ramp up and ramp down phase. These phases are defined as the periods        when the wind tunnel air speed is varying between 15m/s and 95% of the maximum wind        tunnel air speed during a run.     c. Only one model and RATG may be used per run. A maximum of two models may be used        and a single model change made per Competitor per 24 hour period. For the avoidance of        doubt, a model in this context is defined by its underlying spine, motors and sensors.     d. The only permitted degrees of freedom of the model and RATG during a run of RWTT are:        i. Wheel rotation about the wheel axis 
**4. Restricted CFD (RCFD) simulations**     RCFDs are Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations by a Competitor or any Associate     of a Competitor and/or by any contracted party of a Competitor or of any Associate of a     Competitor or any external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or for its own purposes     and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor of flows that are gaseous in     the case of a F1 car and are not classified as power unit simulations. Any simulation of flows     contained within the power unit cooling or lubrication systems, air, air/fuel mixtures,     combustion process or products of combustion from a boundary commencing at the power     unit’s atmospheric air intake ducts, passing through the power unit and finishing at the exit of     the exhaust system will be classified as a power unit simulation.     For the avoidance of doubt, if any CFD simulation (other than the power unit simulation defined     above) reveals information to a Competitor or to an Associate of the Competitor whether     directly, via a contracted party or via an external entity working on behalf of a Competitor or     for its own purposes and subsequently providing the results of its work to a Competitor, about     flows that are gaseous on a F1 car then it is a RCFD simulation. For example, any CFD     simulations conducted at scales other than 1:1 or using non-gaseous fluids are still RCFDs as     they reveal information about flows that are gaseous on the full size F1 car.        a. A RCFDs refers to the pre-processing, the solver part or parts of the simulation process,           and the post processing of the results of the simulation.              i. Pre-processing refers to the meshing, decomposition and setup of the                 simulation. ii. Solver refers to the program or programs that compute the solution of the equations describing the flow including any extension of the simulation or simulations involving additional numerical computation (for example but not limited, to adjoint computation). iii. Post processing refers to the generation of representations of the flow solution that require numerical processing, for example but not limited to the computation of pressure coefficients, velocity, shear stress, flow streamlines or vorticity.

In order that        the FIA may be satisfied that any such movement of staff is compliant with this Article, each        Competitor must inform the FIA of all relevant staff movements at the end of each ATP using        the template which may be found in the Appendix to the Technical and Sporting Regulations        and must demonstrate that they have implemented all reasonable measures to avoid the        disclosure of information, data or designs between the Competitors involved. 
## APPENDIX 9 
## SUPPLY OF POWER UNITS FOR THE 2021 2025 CHAMPIONSHIPS 
**Preamble:** The FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder remain entitled to decide jointly that this Appendix being withdrawn at any time if the number of Power Unit Manufacturers supplying power units in a Championship is less than 3 (three). **a)** As part of the homologation procedure of Appendix 4 of the Sporting Regulations, any Power Unit Manufacturer wishing to supply power units to a Competitor must: i) notify in writing the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January (or such other date as agreed in writing between all of the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) preceding the year during which such power units will be supplied; ii) agree to be bound by the provisions of the Code, the Technical Regulations, the Sporting Regulations, the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules and all other relevant and applicable FIA rules and/or regulations (as supplemented or amended from time to time) and further to observe them; and iii) agree to be subject to the jurisdiction of the internal judicial and disciplinary bodies of the FIA. **b)** No power unit may be used in a given Championship unless the Power Unit Manufacturer supplying such power unit accepts and adheres to the following conditions. Each of the Power Unit Manufacturers of a homologated power unit must: i) provide the FIA, before 15 May (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the Championship preceding that in which such power units are to be supplied, with the list of Competitors (clearly identifying the appointed “works/factory” team, if any) to which a supply agreement has been concluded for the given Championship; ii) if called upon to do so by the FIA before 1 June (or such other date as agreed in writing between all the Power Unit Manufacturers and the FIA) of the Championship preceding that in which such power units were to be supplied, supply at least a number of Competitors (“T”) equal to the following equation: 
# T = (11^1 A)/(B-C) 
**- A** = Total number of Competitors (including “works/factory” teams) having a supply     agreement concluded for the given Championship with a New Power Unit     Manufacturer. 
**- B** = Total number of manufacturers of homologated Power Units for the given     Championship. 
**- C** = Total number of New Power Unit Manufacturers for the given Championship.     provided that if the result contains a fraction then the fraction shall count as a full     Competitor (e.g. 11 Competitors divided by 4 manufacturers = 2.75, each manufacturer     must, if called upon to do so by the FIA, supply at least 3 Competitors). 1 This figure will be reviewed each year as the “total number of entered Competitors” will not be     known until November preceding the Championship. The figure of 11 covers supply of 12     Competitors or less in compliance with the calculation rule. 
**-** Such Competitor has entered into a supply agreement with a Power Unit Manufacturer     for a given Championship before the date set out in Article b)i) above, and 
**-** Such Competitor has been granted a right, under a currently binding offer with a Power     Unit Manufacturer, to be supplied with a power unit for such given Championship. Moreover, such Power Unit Manufacturer shall only be required to supply a New Customer Team if the following cumulative conditions are met. If such conditions are not met, then the Power Unit Manufacturer may, at its sole and exclusive discretion, decline the request to supply such New Customer Team and the decline of such request shall not be deemed to be a breach of the terms set out in this Appendix (however Article c) cannot be applied or interpreted by the Power Unit Manufacturer in a way which would deprive the obligation of supply as referred to in Article b) above of any effect and/or that would prevent the FIA from making and enforcing the provisions set out in Article b) above. The Power Unit Manufacturer undertakes to exercise in good faith the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 to 11 below). The Competitors and the Power Unit Manufacturers remain free to negotiate the terms of the supply agreement, subject to the fall-back positions set out below which shall apply should a Competitor and a Power Unit Manufacturer fail to reach an agreement, despite negotiating in good faith. 
1. For the purpose of this paragraph, supply contract only refers to the contract related to     the FIA Supply Perimeter as per the Sporting and Technical Regulations and as set out in     the Appendix 9A. **1.1** Any supply contract entered into with the New Customer Team must be on     substantially the same terms as those entered into between the Power Unit     Manufacturer and the other customer Competitors (other than its appointed     “works/factory” team) to whom it already supplies a power unit at the date of the     FIA request (“ **Existing Customer Team** ”), other than the Price as referred to in     paragraph 8 below. In particular, the Power Unit Manufacturer may impose and the     Competitor cannot refuse to sign up to any terms which at least one of its other     Existing Customer Teams has agreed to and the Power Unit Manufacturer may     refuse and the Competitor cannot request the inclusion of terms which are not     included in the supply agreements with other Existing Customer Teams. 
2. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion, the     duration of the term of the power unit supply which: **2.1** may not be lower than one Championship; and **2.2** shall not exceed three Championships nor go beyond the end of the 2025     Championship, unless jointly agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New     Customer Team. 
3. The Power Unit Manufacturer shall determine, at its sole and exclusive discretion,     whether the New Customer Team shall use the name of the Power Unit Manufacturer or     the New Customer Team shall operate under a white label/unbranded way and, for this     purpose, use a different name: **3.1** The use of this different name shall always be agreed in advance by the Power Unit     Manufacturer, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; and **3.2** In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is required without being     requested by the New Customer Team, this supply will not incur additional fees for     the New Customer Team except if the use of the power unit name leads to the     conclusion of a commercial agreement between the New Customer Team and any     third party. In that case, the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team     shall enter into good faith negotiations and shall commonly agree on the fair and     reasonable part of the revenues generated by the commercial agreement which     could be considered as additional fees; **3.3** In the event that the white label/unbranded supply is requested by the New     Customer Team and agreed by the Power Unit Manufacturer, this supply may incur     additional fees for the New Customer Team, such fees being determined at the sole     and exclusive discretion of the Power Unit Manufacturer in a fair and reasonable     manner. 
4. The New Customer Team shall provide a warranty that it has no binding contracts or     option(s) in place with another power unit manufacturer for future supply of power units.     The New Customer Team shall be required to terminate any such contracts or option(s)     which do exist in so far as they conflict with any part of the period of the contract being     entered into with the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
5. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) be an     Automotive Manufacturer or any of its affiliated companies which has been set up with     the purpose amongst other things of participating in the Championship. 
6. The New Customer Team shall not (unless the Power Unit Manufacturer agrees) have any     sponsorship agreement in place with any entity, which is in competition with the Core     Activities of an Automotive Manufacturer which are carried out by the Power Unit     Manufacturer. 
7. The New Customer Team and/or any senior executives, directors or beneficial     shareholders of the New Customer Team should not at any time (i) be listed or included     in the official EU and/or US published sanction lists; (ii) have been convicted of any     indictable criminal offence; (iii) have been convicted by any government or government     agency in connection with fraud, money laundering, racketeering or terrorism activities;     and/or (iv) have been declared bankrupt; and/or (v) have committed other identified     action which, in the reasonable opinion of the Power Unit Manufacturer, harms the     reputation of such Power Unit Manufacturer. This clause shall also reciprocally apply to     the Power Unit Manufacturer. 
8. The Power Unit Supply Perimeter listed in Appendix 9A shall be supplied to New Customer     Teams at the Price. The supply of additional goods or services not listed in Appendix 9A (which shall be agreed     between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) shall incur     additional charges, the amount of which shall be substantially the same as that applied by     the Power Unit Manufacturer to its Existing Customer Team. In the event that a Power     Unit Manufacturer has not supplied a power unit to any other Existing Customer Team,     the Power Unit Manufacturer shall decide the price of the above-mentioned additional     goods and services based on the usages and practices generally recognised and respected     in the market for the supply of parts and services in the Championship. 
9. The FIA shall confirm in writing to the Power Unit Manufacturer that, to the best of its     knowledge, the New Customer Team, including its officers, directors and beneficial     shareholders, has not been convicted of non-complying at all times with the FIA Code of     Good Standing. 
10. Payment of the fees (directly or indirectly through a payment guarantee) under the supply     contract for each Championship shall as a fall-back position (unless otherwise agreed     between the Power Unit Manufacturer and the New Customer Team) and,     notwithstanding the terms of any contract with an Existing Customer Team or its own     factory team, be made in four instalments: 
**-** 25% on the date of signature of the supply contract; 
**-** 25% on or before 30 October of the calendar year prior to the year of supply; 
**-** 30% before the start of the Championship; and 
**-** The remaining 20% before the fifth Formula One Event of the Championship. 10.1 In case of any delayed payment for an amount greater than €100,000, the Power     Unit Manufacturer shall send the New Customer Team a written notice of the     breach, with a copy to the FIA and the Commercial Rights Holder. Should the New     Customer Team fail to resolve this breach to the satisfaction of the Power Unit     Manufacturer (with or without the involvement of the FIA and the Commercial     Rights Holder) within thirty days from the issuing of this notice the Power Unit     Manufacturer shall be entitled to either terminate the supply contract immediately     by serving written notice on the New Customer Team, with a copy to the FIA and     the Commercial Rights Holder, or, suspend delivery of the power units to the New     Customer Team. 
11. The New Customer Team and the Power Unit Manufacturer shall not, and will procure its     affiliates and/or their respective senior executives, employees, directors and     shareholders shall not take any action and/or make any omission, deceptive, misleading     or disparaging or negative comments, which directly injures, damages or brings into     disrepute the public reputation, goodwill or favourable name or image of the other party     to the supply agreement. d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.3 of the Sporting Regulations, unless agreed otherwise by the FIA, each of the manufacturers of an homologated power unit may not directly or indirectly supply power units for more than (T+1) Competitors, with T as defined in Article (b). Such consent shall not be given if one or more of the other Power Unit Manufacturers are supplying less that T Competitors. e) Ceasing the supply of the power units. Any manufacturer of a homologated power unit wishing to cease the supply of power units must notify the FIA of its intention to do so no later than 1 January of the year preceding that in which such power units will no longer be supplied. f) In case of any alleged material breach or alleged material failure to comply with any of the obligations of the present Appendix, the FIA shall engage good faith and active discussions with the Power Unit Manufacturer and, in the absence of amicable solution within one month, be entitled to engage proceedings before the FIA International Tribunal against the Power Unit Manufacturer. In the case that, in accordance of the provisions of the Code and of the Judicial and Disciplinary Rules, the International Tribunal rules that the Power Unit Manufacturer has materially breached or materially failed to comply with Articles b) and/or d), the International Tribunal may impose on the Power Unit Manufacturer concerned, to the exclusion of any other sanction it may have the power to impose, a fine (the amount of which shall be no more than twelve million euros and shall be determined, on a case by case basis, depending on the merits and circumstances of the applicable case).

 This base dyno testing limitations includes the provision for any testing for a Competitor for a calendar year (Including but not limited to gearbox, car systems, fuel and engine oil testing). Should a PU supplier provide PU’s to other Competitors who design any of their own car components as listed below, or have their own fuel or oil supplier, a single quota of 30 additional operation hours will be allocated per calendar year and per additional customer Competitor for any combination of the components subject to agreement with the PU supplier and the FIA.: 
- Gearbox and/or gearbox case 
- Exhaust system up to the turbine inlet and/or beyond turbine exit and WG     exit 
- Heat exchangers, their associated accessories and coolant header tanks 
- Clutch and clutch actuation system between the PU and the gearbox 
- Fuel system operating at less than 10 barG and its associated accessories 
- Hydraulic system and hydraulic heat exchangers, other than servo valve(s)     and actuator(s) for PU control. These additional operation hours will not be included in the sum of the operational hours stated in Appendix 10 a) v) and will be specifically and exclusively for the following: 
- Approving the items listed 
- and / or for the sole purpose of the evaluation of the effects of the car     components defined on a Power Train Test Bench on Power Unit     performance and reliability. Should an additional customer Competitor requests to its PU supplier and the FIA to be able to run with a fuel and/or an engine oil different to the one(s) that is(are) already homologated for use with their engine; and should the PU supplier considers that this fuel and/or engine oil is(are) ready to be used in race events, the PU supplier may request approval of this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil. Once this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil are approved, an extra allocation of 30 operation hours may be given by FIA specifically and exclusively for endurance validation of this(ese) fuel and/or engine oil. This extra allocation can only happen a maximum of 2 times per Championship in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and 1 time per Championship from 2023 onwards. In all cases, these additional hours must be jointly declared to FIA by the PU supplier and the customer Competitor. Additional occupancy hours to support the additional operation hours above will be granted at a ratio of 8:1 e) Exceptions: i) Commissioning activities are not counted either for occupancy or operation. **2) ERS dyno limitations** a) Definitions: i) **ERS Test Bench** : An ERS test bench is either an ES test bench, a Power Electronics test bench and/or an MGU test bench. ii) **ES Test Bench** : Test bench facility cell where a complete ES representative of a Formula One ES may be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench definition. iii) **MGU Test Bench** : Test bench facility cell where an MGU (MGU-H or MGU-K) representative of a Formula One part can be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench definition. iv) **Power Electronics Test Bench** : Test bench facility cell where an ERS Control Unit, representative of a Formula One part can be tested. This excludes test bench falling into the Engine test bench definition. v) **Test Bench Occupancy Hours** : Time interval between first work in the bench and last work in the bench in any 24 hours calendar day. Work can be organized in shifts but only two shifts of occupancy may be carried out in any one calendar day. The first shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the current in or out of the tested system is above 1 Amp or when MGU speed is above 100 rpm on a given calendar day, or at the start of the calendar day if these criteria are already met, and will end at a time, declared by the Competitor, when these criteria are no more met on the same calendar day. A second shift of occupancy will be deemed to commence the first time the current in or out of the tested system is above 1 Amp or when MGU speed is above 100 rpm following the end of the first shift of occupancy (on the same calendar day) and will end, either when these criteria are 
- Must be declared to FIA with a minimum of 4 weeks notice 
- Must be approved by FIA 
- A 2 years or more old assembly is used b) Facility Limitations: i) Allowed ES Test Benches are: 
- Any bench where an ES can be installed and run. 
- This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for     example, the engine. 
- ES stationary in space. ii) Allowed MGU Test Benches are: 
- Any bench where an MGU can be installed and run. 
- This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for     example, the engine. 
- MGU stationary in space, installed with horizontal shaft. 
- _MGU-K and MGU-H can be tested simultaneously but no more than one MGU_     _of the same type (i.e.: MGU-K or MGU-H) can be tested at the same time._ 
- _It is permissible to use MGU-K and MGU-H hardware that is at least two years_     _old within the test bench solely as a dynamometers, and these may be_     _controlled using CU’s that are also at least two years old. These devices must_     _be declared to the FIA_ 
- No chassis force actuators. iii) Allowed Power Electronics Test Benches are: 
- Any bench where an ERS Control Unit it can be installed and run. 
- This includes the benches where other PU elements can be tested as, for     example, the engine.
